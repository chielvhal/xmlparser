        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-qf3_s4r_lr">Picture a dim room in the basement of a
            Detroit police station, lined with metal shelves: the shelves contain boxes and boxes of
            cold case files, evidence meticulously logged and categorized for no one to look at,
            documenting murders that will never be solved. Or the library of a small-town historical
            society in New Jersey: struggling with budget cuts, the board of directors has been
            forced to close its doors, locking its treasures inside, carefully curated and preserved
            but inaccessible to the public. Or a valuable data store encoded in an orphaned storage
            format: business records in a legacy database system that will not run on modern
            computers, census data on proprietary magnetic tape reels from the <date>1970s</date>,
            your unfinished novel on a series of eight-inch floppy disks. You know the data is
            there, but you cannot interact with it.</para>
        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-p33_s4r_lr">An organizing system without interactions is
            a sad one indeed.</para>
        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-rk3_s4r_lr">Interactions are the answer to two of the
            fundamental questions we posed back in <xref linkend="chapter-1" xrefstyle="short"/>:
            why and when are the resources organized?</para>
        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-bn3_s4r_lr">The question of <quote>why?</quote> has been
            in the background (and often the foreground) of every chapter in this book thus far;
            whenever we select a resource for inclusion in an organizing system, describe it, or
            arrange it according to an organizing principle, we have an interaction in mind. We
            include a resource in our system because our users will need it; we assign a resource to
            one or more categories to help our users find it, understand it, and connect it with
            other resources in a meaningful way. </para>

        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-ep3_s4r_lr">In this chapter we will pivot from design for
            interactions to the design of interactions—and to do this we must pause to consider the
            question of <quote>when?</quote> In <xref linkend="section-2n.5" xrefstyle="short"/>, we
            contrasted organization done <quote>on the way in</quote> with that done <quote>on the
                way out,</quote> but this distinction is not always a particularly relevant one.
            Consider a bookshelf: if you do not organize its resources on the way in (i.e., when you
            put a book on the shelf), you cannot really organize them on the way out; you just have
            a disorganized bookshelf. When the time comes to retrieve a book, you'll have to employ
            a brute-force linear search algorithm—reading every spine until you find the one you
            want, and it will not make the remaining books on the shelf any more organized.</para>

            <indexterm zone="para-mr3_s4r_lr">
                <primary>location</primary>

            </indexterm></itermset>
        </info>But digital resources and networked organizing systems are an entirely
            different story. In fact, we argue that they blur the traditional boundary between the
            academic disciplines of <quote>information organization</quote> and <quote>information
                retrieval</quote>; with the World Wide Web, ubiquitous digital information, and
            effectively unlimited processing, storage, and communication capability driven by cloud
            computing architecture and Moore’s law, billions of people create and browse websites,
            blog, tag, tweet, and upload and download content of all media types without thinking
                <quote>I am organizing now</quote> or <quote>I am retrieving now.</quote> When
            people use their smartphones to search the web or run applications, location information
            transmitted from their phone is used to filter and reorganize the information they
            retrieve. Arranging results to make them fit the user’s location is a kind of
            computational curation, but because it takes place quickly and automatically we hardly
            notice it. Likewise, almost every application that once seemed predominantly about
            information retrieval is now increasingly combined with activities and functions that
            most would consider to be information organization.</para>
        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-pt3_s4r_lr">Thus we come to the question of when a
            system's resources are organized: we may apply the techniques of computational
            information retrieval to a set of resources that simply are not organized the way we
            need them to be in order to support our desired interaction. Maybe the system was
            designed poorly or for a different purpose than the one we are pursuing; maybe we are
            attempting to collect or aggregate resources from multiple organizing systems, each of
            which has its own separate purposes and design flaws. Regardless of the reasons, what we
            are essentially doing is reorganizing these resources on the fly, or <quote>on the way
                out,</quote> following many of the same principles and procedures we've covered in
            the preceding eight chapters of this book. </para>

        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-wbj_s4r_lr">The fundamental interaction of any organizing
            system is accessing resources or resource descriptions, whether physically or digitally.
            Sometimes we must combine or merge resources or resource descriptions to access them
            effectively; this poses numerous strategy, design, and implementation challenges, as
            producers often use different identifiers, description or cataloging formats, and
            practices for similar resources. Different service providers use different technologies,
            have different information policies, and follow different processes developed in their
            separate organizing systems. </para>
        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-p2j_s4r_lr">Some organizing systems have the power to
            determine the description standards that others must use. Walmart, the largest retailer
            in the United States, has devised an organizing system for its supply chain that
            supports access and movement of physical goods with maximal efficiency and
            effectiveness. This system saves the corporation money on inventory management and
            distribution, but to maximize savings, Walmart requires its suppliers to employ the same
            data model, follow company-set standards, and adopt new technologies such as bar codes
            and RFID tags that support the highly efficient interactions it requires.<footnote

            aggregating the catalogs of more than 250 online stores and providing a seamless access
            interaction for all their merchandise. It does not actually sell anything: it directs
            shoppers to those third-party stores to make their purchases. Rather than moving

                        <orgname>Global Learning Consortium</orgname>, an organization composed of
                    140 members from leading educational institutions and education-related
                    companies, has released specifications to make this possible. Called
                        <citetitle>Common Cartridge and Learning Tools Interoperability</citetitle>
                        (<link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                        xlink:href="http://www.imsglobal.org/commoncartridge.html"
                            ><uri>http://www.imsglobal.org/commoncartridge.html</uri></link>), the
                    specifications provide a common format and guidelines to construct tools and
                    create content that can be easily imported into learning management systems.
                            <citerefentry><refentrytitle>Common
                            Cartridge</refentrytitle><manvolnum>CC</manvolnum></citerefentry>
                    specifications give detailed descriptions of the directory structure, metadata
                    and information models associated with a particular learning object. For
                    example, a learning package from a provider from <orgname>McGraw-Hill</orgname>
                    may contain content from a book, some interactive quizzes, and some multimedia
                    to support the text. CC specifies how files would be organized within a
                    directory, how links would be represented, how the package would communicate
                    with a backend server, how to describe each of the components, and the like.
                    This would enable a professor or a student using any capable learning management
                    system to import a <quote>cartridge</quote> or learning material and have it
                    appear in a consistent manner with all other learning materials within the
                        <abbrev>LMS</abbrev>. This means that content providers need not maintain
                    multiple versions of the same content just to conform to the formats of
                    different systems, allowing them to focus their resources on creating more
                    content as opposed to maintaining the ones they already have. Looking at this in
                    the context of the interoperability framework, we see that while information
                    from providers are in a structured digital form, the main problem was that users
                    were consuming the content using competing systems that had their own data
                    formats by which to accept content. Huge publishers, wanting to increase
                    distribution of their product, offered their content in all these different
                    formats. While the specifications that the <abbrev>LMS</abbrev> created refer to
                    the technical considerations in creating content and tools, the process of
                    getting to that point involved a lot of organizational and political
                    discussions. Internally, content and <abbrev>LMS</abbrev> providers needed to
                    set aside the necessary resources to refactor their products to conform to the
                    standards. Externally, competing providers had to collaborate with one another
                    to create the specifications. </para>
            </footnote> Libraries and museums are the classic examples of this. The most important
            interaction in a library, of course, is borrowing: checking out a book to use it off the
            premises, and checking it back in when you're done. Patrons search descriptions in a
            catalog to find books on a certain topic, by a certain author, or with a certain title,
            and access them by fetching them from the stacks or asking a librarian to retrieve them.
            As institutions that serve the public interest, libraries adhere to standards and
            democratic processes to ensure consistent and familiar user experiences for patrons, but
            also to enable powerful search interactions such as union catalogs, where resource
            descriptions from multiple libraries are merged before they are offered for search.
            Union catalogs allow patrons to find out with a single search whether a resource is
            available from any library that is accessible to them.<footnote xml:id="endnote-497"

            and employ standards and democratic procedures for similar reasons as libraries, but
            their visitors generally look at their resources rather than borrowing them. Museums
            enable people to discover or experience resources by exhibiting artifacts in creative
            contexts, and when they implement this interaction digitally, as in a website, they
            vastly increase the opportunity for public access. Virtual collections are accessible to
            remote patrons who are unable to visit the physical museum, and they allow access to

                than just a few because that would better enable them to select a resource that best

                mental effort, this can cause stress and indecision and might cause people to give
                up. For example, when there were 24 different types of jam offered at an upscale
                market, more people stopped to taste than when only 6 choices were offered, but a
                greater percentage of  people who were presented a smaller number of options

                                    standard used in the European automotive industry. These
                                    standards include formats for a wide range of business
                                    activities, such as shipping notices, fund transfers, and the
                                    like. <abbrev>EDI</abbrev> messages are highly formatted, with

                                    dependent on its position in the document. For instance, a line

                                    specifies the start of a Purchase Order Transaction Set. The
                                    asterisk (*) symbol delineates between items in the line, with
                                    each value corresponding to a particular field or information
                                    component described in the standard. <quote>NE,</quote> for
                                    example, corresponds to the Purchase Order Type Code, which in

                                    exchanging the information must agree on these formats
                                    beforehand, and need to ensure that the information instance is
                                    at the right position within the document so that the receiving
                                    party can correctly interpret it.</para>

                    resources, resource descriptions, and organizing systems as a whole, especially
                    when organizations have disparate systems and redundant information spread
                    across different groups and departments. However, it can also be a costly
                    approach, as integration points may be numerous, with vastly different
                    technologies needed to get one system to integrate with another. Maintenance
                    also becomes an issue, as changes in one system may entail changes in all

                            becomes a problem when working across organizations. Fully integrating
                            systems between two companies, for instance, may entail the exposure of
                            business intelligence and information that should be kept private. This
                            type of exposure is too much for most businesses, regardless of whether
                            the relationship with the other business is collaborative rather than
                            competitive. There are security issues to be considered, as
                            collaborating organizations would need to access private networks and
                            secure servers. The heterogeneity in supporting organizing systems along
                            with the need to quickly evolve with the rapid changes in an
                            organization’s competitive and collaborative environment has pushed
                            organizations to shift from more vertical, isolated structures to a more
                            loosely coupled, ecosystem paradigm This has led to more componentized
                            and modularized systems that need only to exchange information or
                            transform resources when an interaction requires it.</para>
                        <para audience="Business" xml:id="para-o5s_s4r_lr">The emerging paradigm
                            then is to enable independent systems to interoperate, or to have
                                <quote>the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange
                                information and to use the information that has been
                                exchanged.</quote> Because the focus is in the exchange of resources
                            or resource descriptions, independent systems need not necessarily know
                            other systems’ underlying logic or implementation, for example, how they
                            store resources. What is important is knowing what kind of resource is
                            expected and in what format (notation, writing system, semantics), and
                            what kind of information is returned for a particular. This is a
                            strategic approach to exchanging resources, as systems can remain highly
                            independent of each other. Changes in one system need not necessarily
                            affect how other systems work as long as the information that is sent
                            and received through an interface stays the same. This allows greater
                            adaptability, as changes to system logic or business processes can be
                            done in self-contained modules without necessarily affecting others. The
                            transformation then happens in an intermediate space where the
                            agreements on resource descriptions are fixed. </para>

                        hoc</foreignphrase> requirements such as our resources and time, our fellow
                    travelers and their availability, and the bookings for hotel and transportation,
                    as well as desirable destinations and their various offerings. We somehow
                    reconcile the different descriptions used in each of the systems and match these
                    against each other so that the relevant information can be combined and
                    compared. Even though the systems use different formats, vocabularies and
                    structures, they are targeted toward human users and are relatively easy to
                    interpret. For automatic run-time transformations, which need to be handled
                    computationally, designers face the challenge of creating more structured
                    processes for merging information from different systems.<footnote

            mostly distinguish <glossterm linkend="gloss_natural_language_processing">information

            distinguish among interactions is to note whether resources are changed during the
            interaction (e.g., annotate, tag, rate, comment) or unchanged (search, cluster). Yet
            another way would be to distinguish interactions based on their absolute and relative
            complexity, i.e., on the progression of actions or steps that are needed to complete the

                        search</phrase>, a query is specified by stating the information need and
                    using operators from Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) to combine the components. The
                    query is compared to individual resource properties (most often terms), where
                    the result of the comparison is either TRUE or FALSE. The TRUE results are
                    returned as a result of the query, and all other results are ignored. A Boolean
                    search does not compare or rank resources so every returned resource is
                    considered equally relevant. The advantage of the Boolean search is that the
                    results are predictable and easy to explain. However, because the results of the
                    Boolean model are not ranked by relevance, users have to sift through all the
                    returned resource descriptions in order to find the most useful

                            chapter has different combinations of the comparing, ranking, and
                            location activities. Boolean and vector space models compare the
                            description of the information need with the description of the
                            information resource. Vector space and probabilistic models rank the
                            information resource in the order that the resource can satisfy the
                            user’s query. Structure-based search locates information using internal
                            or external structure of the information resource.</para>

                    occurs when resource descriptions have different lengths (a very common
                    occurrence in organizing systems). In order to compensate for different resource
                    description lengths that would bias the term frequency count and the calculated
                    relevance towards longer documents, the length of the term vectors are

                    co-occurrence of terms in a collection. Based on the terms that occur in all
                    resources in a collection, the method calculates which terms might be synonyms
                    of each other or otherwise related. Put another way, latent semantic indexing
                    groups terms into topics. Let us say the terms <quote>roses</quote> and
                        <quote>flowers</quote> often occur together in the resources of a particular
                    collection. The latent semantic indexing methodology recognizes statistically
                    that these terms are related, and replaces the representations of the
                        <quote>roses</quote> and <quote>flower</quote> terms with a computed
                        <quote>latent semantic</quote> term that captures the fact that they are
                    related, reducing the dimensionality of resource description<phrase
                        role="parenthetical"> (see <xref linkend="section-5.3.4.4"/>)</phrase>.
                    Since queries are translated into the same set of components, a query for
                        <quote>roses</quote> will also retrieve resources that mention
                        <quote>flower.</quote> This increases the chance of a resource being found

                    website is as popular as the number of links referencing the website. The actual
                    calculation of a website’s PageRank involves more sophisticated mathematics than
                    counting the number of in-links, because the source of links is also important.
                    Links that come from quality websites contribute more to a website’s PageRank
                    than other links, and links to qualitatively low websites will hurt a website’s

                        highly effective technique employed within bibliographic information
                        systems.</phrase> Bibliographic resources are linked to each other by
                    citations, that is, when one publication cites another. When a bibliographic
                    resource is referenced by another resource, those two resources are probably
                    thematically related. The idea of citation-based search is to use a known
                    resource as the information need and retrieve other resources that are related
                    by citation.</para>

                        resource.</phrase> Another comparison technique is the principle of
                    bibliographic coupling, where the information retrieval system looks for other
                    resources that cite the same resources as the original resource. Citation-based
                    search results can also be ranked, for example, by the number of in-citations a
                    publication has received (the PageRank popularity measure actually derives from
                    this principle).</para>

                constraints that are imposed by the organizing system, its resources and external
                conditions.</phrase> It is very common for processes in interactions to be tweaked
            or tuned to better comply with the original goals and intentions for the interaction.
            Evaluation during these stages often attempts to provide a calculable way to measure
            this compliance and supports the fine-tuning process. It should be an integral part of
            an iterative design process.</para>

        </info>During the later implementation and operation stages, interactions are
            evaluated with respect to the dynamically changing conditions of the organizing system
            and its environment. User expectations as well as environmental conditions or
            constraints can change and need to be checked periodically. A systematic evaluation of
            interactions ensures that changes that affect an interaction are observed early and can
            be integrated in order to adjust and even improve the interaction. At these stages, more
            subjective evaluation aspects like satisfaction, experience, reputation, or
                <quote>feel</quote> also play a role in fine-tuning the interactions. This
            subjective part of the evaluation process is as important as the quantitative, objective
            part. Many factors during the design and implementation processes need to be considered
            and made to work together. Ongoing quality evaluation and feedback ensures that
            interactions work as intended.</para>
        
        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-i3f_t4r_lr">Evaluation aspects can be distinguished in
            numerous ways: by the effort and time to perform them (both data collection and
            analysis); by how quantifiable they are or how comparable they are with measures in
            other organization systems; by what component of the interaction or organizing system

                and economical manner, effective when it performs its actions correctly and
                completely, satisfactory when it performs as expected. Satisfaction is the least
                quantifiable of the evaluation aspects because it is highly dependent on individual
                tastes and experiences.</phrase></para>

                <application>Shopstyle.com</application> develops a new interaction that lets you
            compare coat lengths from the offerings of their various retailers. Once the interaction
            is designed, an evaluation takes place in order to determine whether all coats and their
            lengths are integrated in the interaction and whether the coat lengths are measured and
            compared correctly. The designers would not only want to know whether the coat lengths
            are represented correctly but also whether the interaction performs efficiently. When
            the interaction is ready to be released (usually first in beta or test status), users
            and retailers will be asked whether the interaction improves their shopping experience,
            whether the comparison performs as they expected, and what they would change. These
            evaluation styles work hand in hand in order to improve the interaction.</para>

                then users will not be satisfied by even the most usable interface. Many
                interactions are evaluated with respect to their ability to return relevant
                resources. Why and how this is evaluated is the focus of the remainder of this
                section.</para>

                        of organizing systems, relevance is a concept for evaluating effectiveness
                        that describes whether a stated or implicit information need is satisfied in

                    challenges for the evaluation of relevance in organizing systems is the gap
                    between a user’s information need (often not directly stated), and an expression
                    of that information need (a query). This gap might result in ambiguous results
                    in the interaction. For example, suppose somebody speaks the word
                        <quote>Paris</quote> (query) into a smart phone application seeking advice
                    on how to travel to Paris, France. The response includes offers for the

                    are possible because a desired resource can be searched as precisely as the
                    description or organization of the system allows. However, very specialized
                    description and organization may preclude certain resources from being found;
                    consequently, recall might be sacrificed. If the organization is

                    recall) but you have to sort through a lot of socks to find the right pair (low
                    precision). The trade-off between recall and precision is closely associated
                    with the extent of the organization.</para>

        </info>Although efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction are measured
                differently and affect different components of the interaction, they are equally
                important for the success of an interaction. Even if an interaction is fast, it is
                not very useful if it arrives at incorrect results. Even if an interaction works
                correctly, user satisfaction is not guaranteed. One of the challenges in designing
                interactions is that these factors invariably involve tradeoffs. A fast system
                cannot be as precise as one that prioritizes the use of contextual information. An
                effective interaction might require a lot of effort from the user, which does not
                make it very easy to use, so the user satisfaction might decrease. The priorities of
                the organizing system and its designers will determine which properties to
                optimize.</para>

                    <orgname>Shopstyle</orgname> coat-length comparison interaction example. When
                the coat length calculation is performed in an acceptable amount of time and does
                not consume a lot of the organizing systems resources, the interaction is efficient.
                When all coat lengths are correctly measured and compared, the interaction is
                effective. When the interaction is seamlessly integrated into the shopping process,
                visually supported in the interface, and not cognitively exhausting, is it probably
                satisfactory for a user, as it provides a useful service (especially for someone
                with irregular body dimensions). What aspect should Shopstyle prioritize? It will
                probably weigh the consequences of effectiveness versus efficiency and satisfaction.
                For a retail- and consumer-oriented organizing system, satisfaction is probably one
                of the more important aspects, so it is highly likely that efficiency and
                effectiveness might be sacrificed (in moderation) in favor of satisfaction.</para>
