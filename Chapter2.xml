            <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-hl5_wnr_lr">Selection must be an intentional process
                because, by definition, an organizing system contains resources whose selection and
                arrangement was determined by human or computational agents, not by natural
                processes. And given the broad definition of resource as <quote>anything of value
                    that can support goal-oriented activity</quote> it follows that resources should
                be selected by an implicit or explicit assessment to determine whether they can be
                used to achieve those goals. So even though particular selection methods and
                criteria vary across resource domains, their common purpose is to determine how well
                the resource satisfies the specifications for the properties or capabilities that
                enable a person or nonhuman agent to perform the intended activities. <quote>Fitness
                    for use</quote> is a common and concise way to summarize this idea, and while it
                highlights the need to have activities in mind before resources are selected to
                enable them, it also explains why precise selection criteria are harder to define
                for organizing systems that have diverse sets of stakeholders or users with
                different goals, like those in public libraries.</para>
            <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-w3z_wjw_1w">Many resources are evaluated and selected
                one-at-a-time. This makes it impossible to specify in advance every property or
                criterion that might be considered in making a selection decision, especially for
                unique or rare resources like those being considered by a museum or private
                collector. In general, when resources are treated as instances, organizing
                activities typically occur after selection takes place, as in the closet organizing
                system with which we began this chapter.</para>
            <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-wb2_yjw_1w">When the resources being considered for a
                collection are more homogeneous and predictable, it is possible to treat them as a
                class or set, which enables selection criteria and organizing principles to be
                specified in advance. This makes selection and organizing into concurrent
                activities. This would be the case in the data warehouse organizing system, the
                other example at the beginning of this chapter, because each data source can be
                described by a schema whose structure is reflected in the organization of the data
                warehouse. Put another way, as long as subsequent datasets from a specific source do
                not differ in structure, only in temporal attributes like their creation or
                acquisition dates, the organization imposed on the initial dataset can be replicated
                for each subsequent one.</para>
            <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-hj3_zjw_1w">Well-run companies and organizations in
                every industry are highly systematic in selecting the resources that must be managed
                and the information needed to manage them. <quote>Selecting the right resource for
                    the job</quote> is a clichéd way of saying this, but this slogan nonetheless
                applies broadly to raw materials, functional equipment, information resources and
                datasets, and to people, who are often called <quote>human resources</quote> in
                corporate-speak.</para>
            <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-nkj_1kw_1w">For some types of resources, the
                specifications that guide selection can be precise and measurable. Precise
                specifications are especially important when an organizing system will contain or
                make use of all resources of a particular type, or if all the resources produced
                from a particular source become part of the organizing system on some regular
                schedule. Selection specifications can also be shaped by laws, regulations or
                policies that require or prohibit the collection of certain kinds of objects or
                types of information.<footnote xml:id="endnote-036" label="44" audience="Law">

                selects the materials or components that are transformed into its products, it
                carefully evaluates the candidate resources and their suppliers before making them
                part of its supply chain. The manufacturer would test the resources against required
                values of measurable characteristics like chemical purity, strength, capacity, and
                reliability. A business looking for transactional or demographic data to guide a
                business expansion strategy would specify different measurable characteristics; data
                files must be valid with respect to a schema, must contain no duplicates or
                personally identifiable information, and must be less than one month old when they
                are delivered. Similarly, employee selection has become highly data-intensive;
                employers hire people after assessing the match between their competencies and
                capabilities (expressed verbally or in a resume, or demonstrated in some
                qualification test) and what is needed to do the required activities.<footnote

                        probably does not matter to the customer which delivery service handles his

                internal services with ones provided by others via Application Programming

                        donor heirs or descendant groups; in the USA, much controversy exists
                        because museums contain many <hardware>human skeletal remains and

                    <para xml:id="para-p1r_cpw_1w" audience="Museums">Adding a resource to a museum implies an
                        obligation to preserve it forever, so many museums follow rigorous
                        accessioning procedures before accepting it. Likewise, archives usually
                        perform an additional appraisal step to determine the quality and value of
                        materials offered to them. </para>
                    <para xml:id="para-ew2_fpw_1w" audience="Archives">In archives, common appraisal criteria include
                        uniqueness, the credibility of the source, the extent of documentation, and
                        the rights and potential for reuse. To oversimplify: libraries decide what
                        to keep, museums decide what to accept, and archives decide what to throw
                        away.</para>

                combination. It would be desirable for data to be timely, accurate, complete, and
                consistent, but these criteria trade off against one other, and any prioritization
                that values one criterion over another is somewhat subjective. In addition,
                explicitly subjective perceptions of resource quality are hard to ignore; people are
                inclined to choose resources that come in attractive packages or that are sold and

                </info>Many of the examples in this section have involved selection principles whose
                purpose was to create a collection of desirable, rare, skilled, or otherwise
                distinctive resources. After all, no one would visit a museum whose artifacts were
                ordinary, and no one would watch a sports team made up of randomly chosen athletes
                because it could never win. However, choosing resources by randomly sampling from a
                large population is essential if your goal is to make inferences about it without
                having to study all its instances. Sampling is especially necessary with very large
                populations when timely decisions are required. A good sample for statistical
                purposes is one in which the selected resources are not different in any important
                way from the ones that were not selected. </para>
            <para xml:id="para-asw_cqw_1w">Sampling is also important when large numbers of
                resources need to be selected to satisfy functional requirements. A manufacturer
                cannot test every part arriving at the factory, but might randomly test some of them
                from different shipments to ensure that parts satisfy their acceptance
                criteria.</para>

                assess what they (or their documents that describe the resources) tell you and the
                credibility they have in telling it. You should also try to evaluate the processes
                or algorithms that produce the resources, and then decide if they are capable of
                yielding resources of acceptable quality.</para>
            <para xml:id="para-u5c_2tw_1w">The best outcome is to find a credible supplier of good
                quality resources. However, if an otherwise desirable supplier does not currently
                produce resources of sufficient quality, it is worth trying to improve the quality
                by changing the process using instruction or incentives. Advocates for open
                government have succeeded in getting numerous US government entities to publish data
                for free in machine-readable formats, but it was partly as a result of somewhat
                subversive demonstration projects and shaming that the government finally created
                data.gov in 2009. A clear lesson from the <quote>quality movement</quote> and
                statistical process control is that interventions that fix quality problems at their

                    Detecting anomalous and duplicate data is especially important because including
                    them can produce misleading statistics and predictions, as well as creating the

                    the two datasets might not be described using the same units at the same point
                    in time. So instead of analyzing and repairing resource instances, data cleaning
                    must now be applied to every resource in a dataset, as when every <quote>Zip

                </info>When you cannot obtain resources directly from their source, even if you have
                confidence in their quality at that point, it is important to analyze any evidence
                or records of their use or interactions as they flow downstream. <phrase

                    />)</phrase> Physical resources are often associated with printed or digital
                documents that make claims about their origin and authenticity, and often have bar
                codes, RFID tags, or other technological mechanisms that enable them to be tracked
                from their headwaters to the places where they are used. Tracking is very important
                for data resources because they can often be added to, derived from, or otherwise
                changed without leaving visible traces. Just as the water from melted mountain snow
                becomes less pure as its flows downstream, a data resource can become
                    <quote>dirty</quote> or <quote>noisy</quote> over time, reducing its quality
                from the perspective of another person or computational agent further downstream.
                Data often gets dirty when it is combined with other datasets that contain duplicate
                or seemingly-duplicate information. Data can also become dirty when the hardware or
                software that stores it changes. Subtle differences in representation formats,
                transaction management, enforcement of integrity constraints, and calculations of
                derived values can change the original data.</para>
            <para xml:id="para-tsd_z1y_mw">In addition, a data resource can become inaccurate or
                obsolete simply because the world that the data describes has changed with the
                passage of time. People move, change jobs, get married or divorced, or die.
                Likewise, companies move, merge, get spun off, or go out of business. A poll taken a
                year before an election is often not a good predictor of the ultimate
                    winner.<footnote audience="Computing" label="55" revision="4.0"

            descriptions and organizing principles that are not inspectable or interpretable by
            people. In some applications more efficient information retrieval or question answering,
            more accurate predictions, or more personalized recommendations justify making the
            tradeoff. But comprehensibility is critical in many medical, military, financial, or
            scientific applications, where trusting a prediction can have life or death implications

                <para revision="3.0" revisionflag="added">This inescapable aspect of visual
                    perception was first formalized by German psychologists starting a century ago
                    as the Gestalt principles (see the sidebar, <xref
                        linkend="sidebar-GestaltPrinciples"/>). Likewise, because people
                    have limited attentional capacity, we ignore a lot of the ongoing complexity of
                    visual (and auditory) stimulation, making us perceive our sensory world as
                    simpler than it really is. Taken together, these two ideas explain why we
                    automatically or <quote>pre-attentively</quote> organize separate things we see
                    as groups or patterns based on their proximity and similarity. They also explain
                    why arranging physical resources using these quickly perceived attributes can
                    seem more aesthetic or satisfying than organizing them using properties that
                    take more time to understand.  Look at the cover of this book; the most organized arrangement of the colors and shapes just jumps out at you more than the others. </para>

                        other are grouped, complex shapes are viewed as simple shapes that are

                <para>Cities naturally emerge in places that can support life and commerce. Almost
                    all major cities are built on coasts or rivers because water provides
                    sustenance, transportation and commercial links, and power to enable industry.
                    Many very old cities have crowded and convoluted street plans that do not seem
                    intentionally organized, but grid plans in cities also have a very long history.
                    Cities in the Middle East were laid out in rough grids as far back as 2000+ BCE.

                <para>Because the United States, and especially the American West, was not heavily
                    settled until much more recently compared to most of Europe and Asia, it was a
                    place for people to experiment with new ideas in urban design. The natural human
                    tendency to impose order on habitation location had ample room to do just that.
                    The easiest and most efficient way to organize space is using a coordinate grid,
                    with streets intersecting at perpendicular angles. Salt Lake City, Albuquerque,
                    Phoenix, and Seattle are notable examples of grid cities. An interesting hybrid
                    structure exists in Washington DC, which has radiating diagonal avenues overlaid
                    on a grid.<footnote revision="3.0" revisionflag="added" audience="IA" label="64"

                        <para audience="IA">This is not to say that imposing arbitrary grids on top
                            of a physical environment to create a simple and easily understood
                            organization is always desirable. It is essential that any organization
                            imposed on a region be sensitive to any social, cultural, linguistic,
                            ethnic, or religious organizing systems already in place. Much of the
                            recent conflict and instability in the Middle East can be attributed to
                            the implausibly straight line borders drawn by the French and British to
                            carve up the defeated Ottoman Empire a century ago. Because the
                            newly-created countries of Syria and Iraq lacked ethnic and religious
                            cohesion, they could only be held together by dictatorships. <citation

                <para>Built environments influence the expectations, behaviors, and experiences of
                    everyone who enters the space—employees, visitors, customers, and inhabitants are
                    all subject to the design of the spaces they occupy. These environments can be
                    designed to encourage or discourage interactions between people, to create a
                    sense of freedom or confinement, to reward exploration or enforce efficiency,
                    and of course, much much more. The arrangement of the resources in a built
                    environment also encourages or discourages interactions, and sometimes the built
                    environment is designed with a specific collection of resources in mind to
                    enable and reinforce some particular interaction goals or policies.</para>
                <para revision="4.0" revisionflag="changed">If we contrast the built environments of
                    museums, airports, and casinos, and the way in which each of them facilitates or
                    constrains interactions are more obvious. Museums are often housed in buildings
                    designed as architectural monuments that over time become symbols of national,
                    civic, or cultural identity. Many old art museums mimic classical architecture,
                    with grand stairs flanked by tall columns. They have large and dramatic entry
                    halls that invite visitors inside. Modern museums are decidedly less
                    traditional, and  <phrase revision="4.0" revisionflag="added">some</phrase>
                    people complain that the architecture of modern art museums can overshadow the
                    art collection contained within because people are induced to pay more attention
                    to the building than to its contents. </para>
                <para>Some recently built airports have been designed with architectural flair, but
                    airport design is more concerned with efficiency, walkability (maybe
                    with the aid of moving walkways), navigability, and basic comfort for travelers
                    getting in and out the airport. Wide walkways, multiple staircases, and people
                    movers whose doors open in one direction at a time, all encourage people to move
                    in certain directions, sometimes without the people even realizing they are
                    being directed. </para>

                <para>If one accepts the premise that values and bias are at work in decisions about
                    organizing systems, it is difficult not to see it in built environments.
                    Consider queue design in banks, supermarkets, or boarding airplanes. Assuming
                    that it is desirable to organize people efficiently to minimize wait times and
                    crowding, how should the queue be designed? How many categories of people should
                    there be? What is the basis for the categories? </para>

                    supermarket checkout, because people can choose to buy fewer items if they do
                    not want to wait. Similarly, it seems essential for hospital emergency rooms to
                    have a triage policy that selects patients from the emergency room queue based
                    on their likely benefit from immediate medical attention. </para>

                <para>There are many other examples of how values and biases become part of built
                    environments. In the mid-20th century the road systems of Long Island in New
                    York were designed with low overpasses, which prevented public buses from
                    passing under them, effectively segregating the beaches. The trend in college
                    campus design after the student protests of the 1960s and 1970s was to create
                    layouts that would prevent or frustrate large demonstrations.<footnote

                            nine feet) that were too low for public buses. Consequently, low-income
                            bus riders (largely people of color) had no way to get to beaches. See

                <para>It is easy to move through an environment and stay oriented if the design is
                    simple and consistent, but most built environments must include additional
                    features or descriptions to assist people in these tasks. Distinctive
                    architectural elements can create landmarks for orientation, and spaces can be
                    differentiated with color, lighting, furnishings, or other means. More
                    ubiquitous mechanisms include signs, room numbers, or directional arrows
                    highlighting the way and distance to important destinations.</para>
                <para>In airports, for example, there are many orientation signs and display
                    terminals that help passengers find their departure gates, baggage, or ground
                    transportation services. In contrast, casinos provide little orientation and
                    navigation support because increased confusion leads to lengthier visits, and
                    more gambling on the part of the casino’s visitors.</para>
                    
                    <para>A recent innovation in wayfinding and orientation mechanisms is to give
                    them sensing and communication capabilities so they can identify people by their
                    smartphones and then provide personalized directions or information. These

                        prevent copying of documents, music or video files, and other digital

                        the scale of the digital collection and whether we focus on individual
                        resources or the entire collection. An email message is an identified
                        digital resource in a standard format, <citerefentry><refentrytitle>RFC

                        the kinds of interactions they support and how easy it is to carry them out,

                        surely seem intangible. Similarly, the organizing system we use to manage
                        email might employ a complex hierarchy of folders or just a single
                        searchable in-box, but whether that organization is implemented in the
                        computer or smart phone we use for email or exists somewhere <quote>in the
                            cloud</quote> for web-based email does not much matter to us either. An
                        email message is tangible when we print it on paper, but all that matters
                        then is that there is well-defined mapping between the different
                        representations of the abstract email resource.</para>

                </info>An organizing system for digital resources can also use digital description
                resources that are associated with them. Since the incremental costs of adding

                are small, collections of both primary digital resources and description resources

                    inherently more arrangements of digital resources than there are for physical
                    ones, but this difference emerges because of multiple implementation platforms

                Nevertheless, the organizing systems for digital books, music and video collections
                often maintain the distinctions embodied in the organizing system for physical
                resources because it enables their co-existence or simply because of legacy inertia.
                As a result, the organizing systems for collections of digital resources tend to be
                coarsely distinguished by media type (e.g., document management, digital music
                collection, digital video collection, digital photo collection, etc.).</para>
            <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-zwy_wnr_lr">Information resources in either physical
                or digital form are typically organized using intrinsic properties like author
                names, creation dates, publisher, or the set of words that they contain. Information
                resources can also be organized using  <phrase revision="4.0" revisionflag="added"

                    Information resources can also be organized using behavioral or transactional
                    properties collected about individuals or about groups of people with similar
                    interaction histories. For example, Amazon and Netflix use browsing and

                        associated with them, but the products have no intrinsic order, so no

                <para audience="CogSci">Memories can be viewed either as physical (because at some
                    level they are represented in the brain) or as digital (because they are
                    retrieved as electrical impulses), but memory techniques like the method of loci
                    and memory palaces reify this duality in an interesting way.</para>
                <para audience="CogSci">While physical resources must be stored in physical
                    locations, our powerful spatial memory provides an opportunity for us to, in a
                    sense, store mental resources in physical locations. Our hippocampus, the brain
                    component dedicated to memory, is highly developed for storing and recalling
                    memories of physical locations. The ancient Greeks relied on this capability and
                    devised a mnemonic system—the method of loci—which involved attaching things to
                    remember, the key ideas in a speech perhaps, to well-known physical locations.
                    While giving the speech, then, all one must do is imagine walking through that
                    physical location from idea to idea. Today, champion memorizers use this
                    technique to associate items with places in vividly imagined <quote>memory
                        palaces.</quote> While you may not be interested in memorizing the order of
                    a deck of cards, recognizing the power of our spatial memory may be worth
                    considering when designing your organizing system or when analyzing the
                    successes or failures of a system.<footnote label="75" audience="CogSci"

                property, with the simplest being the number of resources that have the property or
                some particular value of it, such as the number of times a particular word occurs in
                a document or the number of copies a book has sold. Comparing summary statistics
                about a collection with the values for individual resources helps you understand how
                typical or representative that resource is. If you can compare your height of 6
                feet, ½ inch with that of the average adult male, which is 5 feet, 10 inches, the
                difference is two and a half inches, but what does this mean? It is more informative
                to make this comparison using the standard deviation, which is three inches, because
                this tells you that 68% of adult men have heights between 5 feet, 7 inches and 6
                feet, 1 inch. When measurements are normally distributed in the familiar bell-shaped
                curve around the mean, the standard deviation makes it easy to identify statistical
                outliers. </para>
            <para xml:id="para-gzk_zcd_fw">No matter how measurements are distributed, it can be
                useful to employ descriptive statistics to organize resources or observations into
                categories or quantiles that have the same number of them. Quartiles (4 categories),
                deciles (10), and percentiles (100) are commonly used partitions. </para>
            <para xml:id="para-lzq_zcd_fw">Alternatively, resources or observations can be organized
                by visualizing them in a histogram, which divides the range of values into units
                with equal intervals. Because values tend to vary around some central tendency, the
                intervals are unlikely to contain the same number of observations. Descriptive
                statistics and associated visualizations can suggest which properties make good
                organizing principles because they exhibit enough variation to distinguish resources
                in their most useful interactions. For example, it probably isn’t useful to organize
                books according to their weight because almost all books weigh between ½ and 2
                pounds, unless you are in the business of shipping books and paying according to how
                much they weigh.</para>

                    principles. In addition, data visualization makes it easy to recognize values
                    that are typical or that are outliers. Some of this analysis might form part of
                    data quality assessment during resource selection, but if not done then, it

            interactions that are enabled because of the intentional acts of description or
            arrangement that transform a collection of resources into an organizing system. With
            physical resources, it is easy to distinguish the interactions that are designed into
            and directly supported by an organizing system because of intentional acts of
            description or arrangement from those that can take place with resources after they have
            been accessed. For example, when a book is checked out of a library it might be read,
            translated, summarized, criticized, or otherwise used—but none of these interactions
            would be considered a capability of the book that had been designed into the library.
            Some physical resources can initiate interactions, as surely <quote>human
                resources</quote> and <quote>smart</quote> objects with sensors and other
            capabilities can, but most physical resources are passive. We will discuss this idea of

            organizing systems that contain digital resources the logical boundary between the
            resources and their interactions is less clear because what you can do with a digital
            resource is often not apparent. Furthermore, some of the interactions that are outside
            of the boundary with physical resources can be inside of it with digital ones. For
            example, when you check a printed book out of the library, it is no longer in the
            library when you translate it. But a digital book in the <application>Google

                similar difficulty exists when we look at resource descriptions and data
                collections, where we often cannot tell just by examining their values what kinds of
                interactions and operations with them are sensible. Think of all the different kinds
                of information that might be associated with a collection of people like the
                students in a university. A database might contain student names, student IDs,
                gender, birth dates, addresses, a numeric code for academic major, course units
                completed, grade point average, and other information. These pieces of information
                differ in their data type; some are integers, some are real numbers, some are
                Boolean, and some are just text strings. The numeric data also differs in the level
                of measurement it represents. Student IDs and the academic major codes are nominal
                data, the house or apartment number in the address is ordinal data, and the course
                units and grade point average are interval data. Data type and level of measurement
                influence the kind of interactions that are meaningful; we can create an
                alphabetical list of students using their last names, count up the number of
                students with the same academic major, and calculate the average GPA or units
                completed. But it makes no sense to use the numeric codes for academic major to
                compute an average major.</para>

                    traveler’s identity and the time and location of his travel. A New York trip
                    might involve all of these services, and they need to fit together in time and
                    location for the trip to make sense. The hotel reservation needs to begin the
                    day the flight arrives in the destination city, the limousine service needs to
                    meet the traveler shortly after the plane lands, and the restaurant reservation
                    should be convenient in time and location to the hotel.</phrase><footnote

                computing information could be completely separated from the value created by
                physical actions and person-to-person encounters. This configuration of value
                creation enables automated self-service, in which the human service provider can be

                    </info>However, for most people the primary purpose of interacting with a
                    library is to access the information contained in its resources. Many people
                    prefer accessing digital documents or books to accessing the original physical
                    resource because the incidental physical and interpersonal interactions are
                    unnecessary. In addition, many library searches are for known items, which is
                    easily supported by digital search.<footnote xml:id="endnote-069" label="95"

                            searches for known items, and serendipitous interactions with previously
                            unknown resources are often the goal of museum visitors. As a result,
                            few museum visitors would prefer an online visit to experiencing an
                            original painting, sculpture, or other physical artifact. However, it is
                            precisely because of the unique character of museum resources that
                            museums allow access to them but do not allow visitors to borrow them,
                            in clear contrast to libraries.</para>

                    </info>Interactions with physical resources often have highly tangible results;
                    in the preceding examples of fulfillment and delivery interactions, resources
                    move from one location to another. However, an abstract or architectural
                    perspective on interaction design and value creation can create more flexibility
                    in carrying out the interactions while still producing the expected value for
                    the user. In general, more abstract descriptions of interactions and services
                    allow for transparent substitution of the implementation, potentially enabling a
                    computational process to be a substitute for one carried out by a person, or
                    vice versa.</para>
                <para audience="Business Computing IA" xml:id="para-ph5_hlg_5w">For example, a user
                    buying from an internet-based store need not know and probably does not care
                    which service delivers the package from the warehouse. Presenting the
                    interaction to the shopper as the <quote>delivery service</quote> rather than as
                    a <quote>FedEx</quote> or <quote>UPS</quote> service allows the retailer to
                    choose the best service provider for each delivery. Going even further, if you
                    need printed documents at a conference, sales meeting, or anywhere other than
                    your current location, the interaction you desire is <quote>provide me with
                        documents</quote> and not <quote>deliver my documents.</quote> It does not
                    matter that FedEx will print your documents at their destination rather than
                    shipping them there.</para>

                                    Dematic Group stores books in bins stacked on three-story-tall
                                    metal racks in five long aisles. Instead of using a library
                                    classification scheme, books are stored according to their sizes
                                    in one-foot deep metal bins, which contain about one hundred
                                    books each. Given an online catalog request for a book, the
                                    system looks up the bin where it was last stored, and then
                                    directs a robot to bring that bin to the circulation desk. Human
                                    librarians then find the requested book in the bin and scan its
                                    barcode, which notifies the requester that the book can be
                                    picked up. To store a book, the librarian scans its barcode, and
                                    it is then stored in the closest bin with available
                                    space.</para>

                    resource accessible involve transforming the resource or its description into a
                    different form so someone who could not perceive it or interact with it in its
                    original form can now do so. The most common operating systems all come with
                    general-purpose accessibility features such as reading text aloud, recognizing
                    speech, magnifying text, increasing cursor size, signaling with flashing lights
                    instead of with sounds, lights to signal keyboard shortcuts for selecting and
                    navigating, and connecting to devices for displaying Braille. Google Translate
                    converts text in one language to another, and many people use it to create a
                    rough draft that is finished by a human translator.<footnote label="106"

                    </info>Transforming recorded spoken language to text to make it accessible and
                    searchable is called transcription. At times transcription is necessary to
                    comply with accessibility requirements, but is often done simply to add
                    organization to content, as when a script is created to separate the multiple
                    voices in a radio or television interview or story. </para>
                <para  audience="Computing" revision="3.0" revisionflag="added">Transcriptions created by skilled people
                    are highly accurate but labor-intensive to produce, so speech-to-text software
                    is increasingly being used to transcribe speech using pre-trained acoustic and
                    language models. Training these models is computationally intensive, and there
                    are many clever techniques to acquire the <quote>labeled</quote> inputs.
                    However, most of them are conceptually simple; they take the huge amount of data
                    collected by voice search applications and analyze what the searcher does with
                    the results to assess the accuracy of the transcription. Transcription accuracy
                    can be improved when models can be specialized by industry or application. For
                    example, speech-to-text software for doctors is trained to recognize medical
                    terminology, while software for use by generic voice recognition services like
                    Apple's is trained to understand dictation and commands or questions one would
                    ask of a smartphone. </para>
                <para revision="3.0" revisionflag="added">Since text transcripts are
                    machine-readable, unlike audio or video files, adding text transcripts makes it
                    possible for search engines to index audio and video in ways that were
                    previously impossible. Pop Up Archive, an audio search company in Oakland,
                    California, works with speech-to-text software specially trained for news media
                    and spoken word content to make radio, podcasts, and archival audio searchable.
                    A challenge for audio search is that even though a transcription with a few
                    mistakes works just fine for search engines, people often expect transcriptions
                    to be perfect.<footnote label="110" audience="Computing" revision="3.0"

            Selection is based on an initial set of rules that determine which resources enter the
            organizing system. Maintenance includes the work to preserve the resources, the
            processes for evaluating and revising the original selection criteria, and the removal
            of resources from the system when they no longer need to be preserved. More stringent
            rules for selecting resources generally imply a maintenance plan that carefully enforces
            the same constraints that limit selection. This is just common sense whether the
            resource is a piece of art, an automobile, a software package, or a star basketball
            player; if you worked hard to find or paid a lot to acquire a resource, you are going to
            take care of it and will not soon be buying another one.</para>

                        printed and digital resources they rely on; the former are probably kept in
                        folders or in piles on the desk, and the latter in a computer file system.
                        This organizing system is not likely to be preserved after the term paper is
                        finished. An exception that proves the rule is the task of paying income

                        to coordinate the efforts of libraries in managing the digital copies of the

                        digitization projects. Since then the Hathi Trust has broadened its scope to
                        include the public domain books collected by the Internet Archive and
                        numerous other digital collections, and today its digital library has over
                        ten million volumes. The costs of running the Hathi Trust and its digital
                        library are shared in a transparent manner by the institutions that
                        contributed digital collections or that want access to them, which reduces
                        the costs for everyone compared to a <quote>go it alone</quote> strategy.

                        that do not distinguish them. A second important difference between the
                        Hathi Trust Digital Library and commercial search engines is the absence of
                        display advertising and <quote>sponsored search</quote> results.</para>

                    developments in sensor technology enable very extensive data collection about
                    the state and performance of machines, engines, equipment, and other types of
                    physical resources, including human ones. <phrase>(Are you wearing an activity
                        tracker right now?)</phrase> When combined with historical information about
                    maintenance activity, predictive analytics techniques can use this data to
                    determine normal operating ranges and indicators of coming performance
                    degradation or failures. Predictive maintenance can maximize resource lifetimes
                    while minimizing maintenance and inventory costs. These techniques have recently
                    been used to predict when professional basketball players are at risk of an
                    injury, potentially enabling NBA teams to identify the best time to rest their
                    star players without impairing their competitive strategy.<footnote

                        upended the conversation with an unapologetic dogma of removal that promises
                        to yield a happier—and much more minimalist—life for individuals with their

                    <para>Kondo’s method mandates that only what brings one joy may be kept.
                        Everything else must be tossed — unused gifts, books kept only for reference
                        but never referenced, unworn clothing, and anything else that does not bring
                        its owner joy. Kondo’s approach is designed for personal organizing systems,
                        and would be difficult to implement in systems in systems used by multiple
                        individuals, much less institutions. However, Kondo’s rejection of the
                        concept that things should be saved for a rainy day might benefit
                        organizations by making them more attentive to the costs of maintaining
                        resources with no current use. </para>

                        approach implicitly recognizes this limitation by requiring cognitive energy

                            privacy, reputation, or worse. We know too well what spam is. Phishing
                            is a type of spam that directs recipients to a fake website designed to
                            look like a legitimate one to trick them into entering account numbers,
                            passwords, or other sensitive personal information. Malware, fakeware,
                            or spyware sites offer tempting downloadable content that installs
                            software designed to steal information from or take control of the
                            visiting computer. Keyword stuffing, spamdexing, and META tag abuse are
                            techniques that try to mislead search engines about the content of a
                            resource by annotating it with false descriptions. Link farms or scraper
                            sites contain little useful or original content and exist solely for the
                            purpose of manipulating search engine rankings to increase advertising
                            revenue. Similarly, cybersquatters register domain names with the hope
                            of profiting from the goodwill of a trademark they do not own.</para>

                    promising new approach to computational curation involves using scientific
                    measuring equipment to analyze damaged physical resources and then building
                    software models of the resources that can be manipulated to restore the
                    resources or otherwise improve access to their content. For example, the first
                    sound recordings were made using rotating wax cylinders; sounds caused a
                    diaphragm to vibrate, the pattern of vibration was transferred into a connected
                    stylus, which then cut a groove into the wax. When the cylinder was rotated past
                    a passive stylus, it would vibrate according to the groove pattern, and the
                    amplified vibrations could be heard as the replayed sound. Unfortunately, wax
                    cylinders from the <date>19th century</date> are now so fragile that they would
                    fall apart if they were played. This dilemma was resolved by

                    an experimental physicist at the <orgname>Lawrence Berkeley
                    Laboratory</orgname>. Haber used image processing techniques to convert
                    microscope-detailed scans of the grooves in the wax cylinders. Measurements of
                    the grooves could then be transformed to reproduce the sounds captured in the
                        grooves.<footnote label="150" revision="3.0" revisionflag="added"

                    data, and might do so without considering that keeping some summary statistics
                    would be valuable for historical analysis. Other firms might be biased towards

                    that the ability to discard without having to reuse is relatively recent.
                    Historically, the urge and need to discard has clashed with the availability of
                    resources. In the Middle Ages, liturgical texts or music would be phased out,
                    perhaps when the music had gone out of style or when entire sections of the
                    liturgy were phased out by decree. When this happened, they would reuse the
                    parchment or vellum, either by scraping it down or by flipping it over, pasting
                    it in a book, and using the other side. The former of these solutions often
                    created a <glossterm linkend="gloss_palimpsest">palimpsest</glossterm>, a
                    document or other resource in which the remnants of older content remain visible
                    under the new. </para>
                
                    <para revision="3.0" revisionflag="added">Some people have difficulty in
                    discarding things, regardless of their actual value. This behavior is called
                    hoarding, and is now regarded as a kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder that
                    requires treatment because it can cause emotional, physical, social, and even
                    legal problems for the hoarder and family members. It seems unsympathetic that
                    many TV shows and stories have been produced about especially compulsive
                    hoarding. A famous example is that of the Collyer brothers in New York, who shut
                    themselves off from the world for years, and when they were found dead inside
                    their home in 1947 it contained 140 tons of collected items, including 25,000
                    books, fourteen pianos, thousands of bottles and tin cans, hundreds of yards of
                    fabrics, and even a Model T car chassis.<footnote label="153"

                    and scientific organizing systems rather than in libraries, archives, and
                    museums. Governance has a broader scope than curation because it extends beyond
                    the resources in a collection and also applies to the software, computing, and
                    networking environments needed to use them. This broader scope also means that
                    governance must specify the rights and responsibilities for the people who might
                    interact with the resources, the circumstances under which that might take
                    place, and the methods they would be allowed to use.</phrase></para>

                        but there are many thousands of these datasets. Other dark data comes from
                        research that fails to find effects; because these negative findings are
                        less likely to be published, literature reviews can be skewed by their
                        omission. Just as <application>Netflix</application> makes the long tail of
