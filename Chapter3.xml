                organizing them is not always obvious, or at least not obvious to each of us in the
                same way at all times. Not everyone thinks of them in the same way. Recognizing
                something in the sense of perceiving it as a <hardware>tangible thing</hardware> is
                only the first step toward being able to organize it and other resources like it.
                Which properties garner our attention, and which we use in organizing depends on our
                experiences, purposes, and context.</para>

                <phrase role="statement">We can describe the same resource in many different ways.
                    At various times we can consider any given resource to be one of many members of
                    a broad category, as one of the few members of a narrow category, or as a unique
                    instance of a category with only one member.</phrase> For example, we might
                recognize something as a piece of clothing, as a sock, or as the specific dirty sock
                with the hole worn in the heel from yesterday’s long hike. </para>
            <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-cjj_csq_vw">However, even after we categorize
                something, we might not be careful how we talk about it; we often refer to two

                    <quote>the same type of thing.</quote> Indeed, we could debate whether a
                category with only one possible member is really a category, because it blurs an
                important distinction between particular items or instances and the class or type to

                we need to make about resource instances and resource classes and types are not
                completely separable. Nevertheless, we will strive to focus on the former ones in

                    you are imagining the car being assembled you might think of several dozen large
                    parts like the frame, suspension, drive train, gas tank, brakes, engine, exhaust
                    system, passenger compartment, doors, and other pre-assembled components. Of
                    course, each of those components is itself made up of many
                        parts<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>think of the engine, or even just the radio.
                    Some sources have counted ten or fifteen thousand parts in the average car, but
                    even at that precise granularity a lot of parts are still complex things. There
                    are screws and wires and fasteners and on and on; really too many to

                    the number of parts in the whole holds for information resources too; a
                    newspaper can be considered a single resource but it might also consist of
                    multiple sections, each of which contains separate stories, each of which has

                    resources or surrogates, like bibliographic records that describe the

                            of modern taxonomy (which is unfair to Aristotle) but he certainly
                            deserves enormous credit for the systematic approach to biological
                            classification that he proposed in <citetitle linkend="Linnaeus1735"

                constraints on category membership that exist as patterns of shared and correlated
                properties; a resource identified as a member of one category must also be a member
                of another with which it shares some but not all properties. For example, a marble
                statue in a museum must also be a kind of material, and a fish in an aquarium must
                also be a kind of animal.</para>

                    documents can be distinguished according to the extent to which their content is
                    semantically prescribed, by the amount of internal structure, and by the
                    correlations of their presentation and formatting to their content and
                    structure. These three characteristics of content, structure, and presentation

                    authored by people and are heterogeneous in structure and content, and their
                    content is usually just prose and graphic elements. Their presentational
                    characteristics carefully reinforce their structure and semantics; for example,
                    the text of titles or major headings is large because the content is important,
                    in contrast to the small text of footnotes. Transactional document types are
                    usually created mechanically and, as a result, are homogeneous in structure and
                    content; their content is largely <quote>data</quote>

                <para>Earlier editions of this book sidestepped the question of people as resources
                    to avoid complicating the Discipline of Organizing. People organize themselves
                    in innumerable ways to coexist, share knowledge, and accomplish more than they
                    could as individuals, and behaviors such as trust and reciprocity might be
                    considered <quote>organizing principles</quote> for human society. But these
                    organic relationships and interactions usually lack the intentional arrangement
                    to be considered true Organizing Systems, except when the people are living in
                        <quote>intentional communities.</quote><footnoteref linkend="endnote-005a"
                        audience="Philosophy" revision="3.0" revisionflag="added"/></para>
                <para>However, people do qualify as resources in Organizing Systems under our
                    definition: just like digital and physical resources, human resources can be
                    identified, categorized, described in terms of their attributes and
                    relationships, and take part in interactions to create value. In businesses,
                    people are organized to amplify their skills, knowledge, and agency. A company’s
                    organizational chart is often a formal hierarchy in which each worker’s role is
                    defined through his or her responsibilities and relationships to others in the
                    company. Treating an employee abstractly as a resource with specific and
                    predictable functions, inputs, and outputs enables employees or processes to
                    depend upon each other without being distracted by the details of one another’s
                    work. This so-called <quote>black boxing</quote> can encourage specialization
                    and allow an organization to function more efficiently. </para>
                <para audience="Business">Nevertheless, while organizational charts are typically
                    presented as neat hierarchies, human relationships cut across the hierarchy to
                    create a network, and may be complicated by differing values and motivations.
                    Conflicting incentives and lack of communication between people may cause
                    breakdowns in the system. People are more than the sum of properties used to
                    organize them: understanding and defining employees’ roles too narrowly could
                    exclude the aspects of the job that they find rewarding or consider part of
                    their professional identity, while black boxing people’s labor and treating them
                    as <quote>remote person calls</quote> also risks dehumanizing them and ignoring
                    their working conditions.</para>

        </info>The minimal capability for a resource to have some
                                agency is for it to be able to sense or be aware of some aspect of
                                its environment or its interactions with other resources. A
                                thermometer measures temperature, a photodetector measures light, a
                                gauge measures the fuel left in a car’s gas tank, a GPS device
                                computes its location after detecting and analyzing signals from
                                satellites, a wearable fitness sensor tracks your heartbeat and how
                                far you walk. But sensing something in itself does not create any
                                value in an organizing system. Something needs to be done. </para></listitem>

                a forward, reply, link, etc.) is less important. However, for firms that use Twitter

                </info>As another example, players on professional sports teams are human resources,
                but millions of people participate in fantasy sports leagues where teams consist of
                resources based on the statistics generated by the actual human players. Put another
                way, the associated resources in the actual sports are treated as the primary ones
                in the fantasy leagues.<footnote xml:id="endnote-144" label="182"

                        </info>The basic idea behind fantasy sports is quite simple. You select a
                        team of existing players in any sport, and then compare their statistical
                        performance against other teams similarly selected by other people. Fantasy
                        sports appeal mostly to die-hard fans who study player statistics carefully
                        before <quote>drafting</quote> their players. The global fantasy sports
                        business for companies who organize and operate fantasy leagues is estimated

                    online library catalog used to find the shelf location of <hardware>physical

                    replaced the physical cards with database records. The online catalogs for

                    or other museum object that each catalog entry describes.</para>

                domain, and then specifying the principles by which those properties encapsulate or
                define the relationships among the resources are the essential tasks when building
                any organizing system.</phrase> In organizing systems used by individuals or with

            are therefore idiosyncratic and do not scale well. At the other extreme, organizing
            systems designed for institutional or industry-wide use, especially in
            information-intensive domains, require systematic design methods to determine which
            resources will have separate identities and how they are related to each other. These
            resources and their relationships are then described in conceptual models which guide
            the implementation of the systems that manage the resources and support interactions
            with them.<footnote xml:id="endnote-148" label="186" audience="Computing">

        </info>These two criteria for determining the identity of information
                components are often easy to satisfy through observations, interviews, and task
                analysis because people naturally use many different types of information and talk
                easily about specific components and the documents that contain them. Some common
                components (e.g., person, location, date, item) and familiar document types (e.g.,
                report, catalog, calendar, receipt) can be identified in almost any domain. Other
                components need to be more precisely defined to meet the more specific semantic
                requirements of narrower domains. These smaller or more fine-grained components
                might be viewed as refined or qualified versions of the generic components and
                document types, like course grade and semester components in academic transcripts,
                airport codes and flight numbers in travel itineraries and tickets, and drug names

                        Imagine that a business keeps information about customer orders using a
                            <quote>spreadsheet</quote> style of organization in which a row contains
                        cells that record the date, order number, customer name, customer address,
                        item ID, item description, quantity, unit price, and total price. If an
                        order contains multiple products, these would be recorded on additional
                        rows, as would subsequent orders from the same customer. All of this
                        information is important to the business, but this way of organizing it has
                        a great deal of redundancy and inefficiency. For example, the customer
                        address recurs in every order, and the customer address field merges street,
                        city, state and zip code into a large unstructured field rather than
                        separating them as atomic components of different types of information with
                        potentially varying uses. Similar redundancy exists for the products and
                        prices. Canceling an order might result in the business deleting all the
                        information it has about a particular customer or product.</para>

                        item information. This normalized information model encodes all of the

        </info>But the theoretically grounded methods
                for identifying components like those of relational theory and normalization that work for structured data do not strictly apply when
                information requirements are more qualitative and less precise at the narrative end
                of the Document Type Spectrum. These information requirements are typical of
                narrative, unstructured and semi-structured types of documents, and information
                sources like those often found in law, education, and professional services.
                Narrative documents include technical publications, reports, policies, procedures
                and other less structured information, where semantic components are rarely labeled
                explicitly and are often surrounded by text that is more generic. Unlike
                transactional documents that depend on precise semantics because they are used by
                computers, narrative documents are used by people, who can ask if they are not sure
                what something means, so there is less need to explicitly define the meaning of the

                    organizing systems that treat its resources as passive.</phrase> In a
                traditional library, books sat passively on shelves and required users to read their

                them as passive resources; superimposed on that traditional organizing system is one

                <phrase role="statement">A large collection of sensors can transmit a torrent of

                challenge gets qualitatively more difficult as the amount of data grows to

                ignored, but if there are a thousand similar outliers in a billion sensor readings,
                this cluster of data probably reveals something important. On the other hand, giving
                every sensor the computing capability to refine its data so that it only
                communicates significant information might make the sensors too expensive to

                        modeling to make optimal use of the data. In designing <glossterm

                        people, it is helpful to create a smart model in order to predict the kinds
                        of patterns and locations relevant to the data collected or monitored. These
                        allow designers to develop a set of dimensions and principles that will act
                        as smart guides for the development of smart things. Modeling helps to
                        enable automation, security, or energy efficiency, and baseline models can
                        be used to detect anomalies. As for location, exact locations are

                                        It was one of the first fast-food chains to go
                                        international, and in <date>1987</date> was the first

                        domain name of the server on which the resource is located, followed by the
                        directory path and file name on the computer running the server.</phrase>
                    This treats the current location of the resource as its name, so the name will
                    change if the resource is moved. It also means that resources that are identical
                    in content, like those at an archive or mirror website, will have different
                    names than the original even though they are exact copies. An analogous problem
                    is faced by restaurants or businesses with street names or numbers in their
                    names if they lose their leases or want to expand.<footnote xml:id="endnote-166"

                    </info>People change their names for many reasons: when they get married or
                    divorced, because their name is often mispronounced or misspelled, to make a
                    political or ethnic statement, or because they want to stand out. A few years a
                    football player with a large ego named <personname><firstname>Chad</firstname>
                        <surname>Johnson</surname></personname>, which is the second most common
                    surname in the US, decided to change his name to his player number of 85,
                    becoming Chad <quote>Ochocinco.</quote> He had an
                        <application>ochocinco.com</application> website and used the ochocinco name
                    on <application>Facebook</application> and <application>Twitter</application>.
                    In a bit of irony, when Ochocinco wanted to put Ocho Cinco on the back of his
                    football jersey, the football league would not let him because his legal name
                    does not have a space in it. That surely contributed to his decision to change
                    his name back to Chad Johnson in <date>2012</date>.</para>
                <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-cnh_znr_lr">When you go to coffee shops, you are
                    often asked your name, which the cashier writes on the empty cup so that your

                    as some establishments use a receipt number to distinguish orders, what they
                    need is an identifier. So even if your name is Joe, you can tell them it is
                    Thor, Wotan, Mercurio, El Greco, Clark Kent, or any other name that is likely to
                    be a unique identifier for the minute it takes to make your beverage.<footnote

                        <quote>G</quote> name and a <quote>V</quote> name, but using
                        <quote>G</quote> is the authoritative way. <quote>See</quote> and <quote>see

                        name.<footnote xml:id="endnote-175" label="212" audience="LIS">

                                        because of its large and unattractive teeth became popular
                                        in American restaurants when a fish wholesaler began
                                        marketing it as the Chilean Sea Bass even though it is
                                        usually found farther south in cold Antarctic waters and it
                                        is not a sea bass. Unfortunately for the fish, this alias
                                        was so successful that it led to overfishing, threatening
                                        the survival of the species. Some environmentally-oriented
                                        chefs, restauranteurs, and seafood distributors organized a
                                        boycott to save the fish. <citation

                    think of persistence more abstractly, and consider as persistent resources any
                    that remain functionally the same to support the same interactions at any point
                    in their lifetimes, even if their physical properties or information values

                    deemed to be persistent from the perspective of  other resources that use them.
                    Similarly, the dataset that defines a user or customer model in a recommendation
                    system should be treated as a persistent resource; it includes information like
                    name and date of birth that is persistent in the traditional sense; but it might
                    also include <quote>last purchase</quote> and <quote>current location,</quote>
