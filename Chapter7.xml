                    >classifications</glossterm>. A system of categories captures the distinctions
                and relationships among its resources that are most important in a domain and for a
                particular context of use, creating a reference model or conceptual roadmap for its
                users.</phrase> This classification creates the structure and support for the
            interactions that human or computational agents perform. For example, research libraries
            and bookstores do not use the same classifications to organize books, but the categories
            they each use are appropriate for their contrasting types of collections and the
            different kinds of browsing and searching activities that take place in each context.
            Likewise, the scientific classifications for animals used by biologists contrast with
            those used in pet stores because the latter have no need for the precise differentiation
            enabled by the former.</para>

                a glib way to describe topic modeling, an unsupervised learning technique for
                organizing and summarizing collections of unstructured documents by discovering
                patterns or clusters in the words they contain. The basic intuition behind topic
                modeling is that the words in a document are probabilistic indications of what the
                document is about; a document that contains words like <quote>election, government,
                    and candidate</quote> is probably about the <quote>politics</quote> topic, while
                words like <quote>adore, wedding, and marriage</quote> are good indications of a
                    <quote>love</quote> topic. Topic models are not quite tagging because the words
                they identify to describe documents are not atomic tags or labels explicitly
                assigned to individual documents. Instead, topics are more like themes that
                different documents are more or less likely to contain.</para>

                        number to books to designate the order in which they are shelved. Most
                        American libraries use a classification system as part of their call number,
                        composing it from a class number of the classification and a unique
                        identifier (derived from the author name and title), which identifies the
                        book within the class, often using a system called Cutter numbers. See <link

        </info>From a library science or collection curation perspective, it seems
                undeniable that when the resources being classified are physical or tangible things
                such as books, paintings, animals, or cooking pots, the end result of the
                classification activity is that some resource has been placed in some physical
                location. Moreover, the placement of physical resources can be influenced by the
                physical context in which they are organized. Once placed, the physical context
                often embodies some aspects of the organization when similar or related resources
                are arranged in nearby locations. In libraries and bookstores, this adjacency
                facilitates the serendipitous discovery of resources, as anyone well knows who has
                found an interesting book by browsing the shelves.</para>

                            organizing system that meets the needs of each participant. But each new
                            person often brings new requirements and it is not feasible to resolve
                            every disagreement between every pair of participants. Instead, for a
                            large-scale organizing system, decisions are usually made by entities
                            that have the authority to coordinate actions and prevent conflicts by
                            imposing a single solution on all the participants. <citation

                            to control how business gets done in its industry. One key part of that
                            is establishing specifications for data formats and classification
                            schemes in organizing systems, which usually means requiring other firms
                            to use the ones developed by the dominant firm for its own use. This
                            ensures the continued efficiency of their own business processes while
                            making it harder for other firms to challenge their market power.</para>

                            that uses them encourages cooperation and adoption. Consensus also
                            underlies the authority of voluntary standards activities, where firms
                            work together under the auspices of a standards body and agree to follow
                            its procedures for creating, ratifying, and implementing

                            authority from the authority of the governments that created them. But
                            standards organizations arguably derive most of their authority from the
                            collective power of their members, because many influential standards

                    </footnote> In addition, implementations of standards often are subject to
                    conformance tests that establish the completeness and accuracy of the
                    implementation. This means that users can decide either to implement the
                    specification themselves or choose from other conforming implementations.</para>

                            standards are used by thousands of firms as specifications and

                            especially component manufacturing and electronics. The specifications
                            are defined using a three-level hierarchy of process clusters, segments,
                            and partner interface processes (PIPs) to enable firms to find a level
                            of process abstraction that works best for them. See <link

                    depends largely on the variety or heterogeneity of the resources that the system
                    of categories has been designed to organize. Because of the diversity of
                    resources for a sale in a department store, a broad classification is necessary
                    to accommodate everything in the store. Kitchen goods will be grouped together
                    in a few aisles on a single floor. But a specialty kitchen store or a wholesale
                    kitchen supply store for restaurants would classify much more precisely because
                    of the restricted resource domain and the greater expertise of those who want to
                    buy things there. An entire section might be dedicated just to knives, organized
                    by knife type, manufacturer, quality of steel, and other categories that are not
                    used in the kitchen section of the department store.<footnote

                        are mutually exclusive. Thus, when a logical concept is assigned to a
                        particular category, it cannot simultaneously be assigned to another
                        category.</phrase> Resources, however, can be assigned to several categories
                    if they embody several concepts represented by those different categories. This
                    can present a challenge when a physical storage solution is based on storing
                    resources according to its assigned category in a logical classification system.
                    This is not a serious problem for resource types like technical equipment or
                    tools, for which the properties used to classify them are highly salient, and
                    that have very narrow and predictable contexts of use. It is also not a problem
                    for highly-specialized information resources like scientific research reports or
                    government economic data, which might end up in only one specialized class.
                    However, many resources are inherently more difficult to classify because they
                    have less salient properties or because they have many more possible
                    uses.</para>

                    of scissors so that scissors can be kept in both locations where they are
                    typically used, but this is not practical for many types of resources and this

                might seem surprising, because many classification systems are formal and
                institutional, created by governments or firms participating in standards
                organizations. We expect these classifications to be impartial and objective.
                However, consider the classification of people as <quote>employed</quote> or
                    <quote>unemployed.</quote> Many people think that any employable person who is
                not currently employed would be counted as unemployed. But the US government’s
                    <orgname>Department of Labor</orgname> only counts someone as unemployed if they
                have actively looked for work in the past month, effectively removing anyone who has
                given up on finding work from the unemployed category by assigning them to a
                    <quote>discouraged worker</quote> category. In <date>2012</date> this
                classification scheme allowed the government to report that unemployment was about
                8% and falling, when in fact it was closer to 20% and rising. The political
                implications of this classification are substantial.<footnote xml:id="endnote-405"

                is often intentionally or unintentionally shown in data visualizations, including
                choropleth maps, in which map regions are colored, patterned, or otherwise
                distinguished according to a statistical variable being displayed on the map.
                Choropleths are commonly used to display election results, with the districts or
                states won by each candidate shown in different colors; in the United States, the
                convention is to show those won by Democratic Party candidates in blue, and those
                won by Republicans in Red. These election choropleths are often misleading because
                coloring an entire state in the winner’s colors ignores population density and the
                regional concentrations of votes that differ from the majority. California voters
                are reliably <quote>blue</quote> as a whole, but as you can see in the nearby figure
                with election results divided by county, this majority is amassed in the large
                cities along the coast, and inland and rural counties are more reliably
                    <quote>red</quote> in their voting.</para>

                categories might present data divided into equal range intervals, into sets with the

                intentionally or inadvertently, and sometimes despite one’s best intentions to

                ripe for this sort of bias: alphabetical ordering, processes that rely on
                pseudo-random number generation, and other automated ways of sorting or grouping
                resources may systematically create different opportunities for different user

                or a change in that population over time, there is a mismatch between users and the
                system. User interfaces are especially susceptible to this form of bias, given their
                need to reflect the habits and capacities of intended users. Unfairness can emerge

                think about bias in classification is that the choices made in an organizing system
                about resource selection, description, and arrangement come together to convey the
                values of the organizers. This makes a classification a rhetorical or communicative
                vehicle for establishing credibility and trust with those who interact with the
                resources in the classification. Seen in this light, an objective or neutral
                classification is not only unrealistic as a goal; it may also consume valuable time
                and energy when instead it might be more desirable to seize the opportunity to
                interpret the resources in a creative way to communicate a particular message to a
                particular user group. Melanie Feinberg makes the point that <quote>fair

                    conditions of the societies that created them. As early as the third millennium
                    BCE, there were enough written documents—papyrus scrolls or clay tablets—that
                    the need arose to organize them. Some of the first attempts, by Mesopotamian
                    scribes, were simple lists of documents in no particular order. The ancient
                    Greeks, Romans, and Chinese created more principled systems, both sorting works
                    by features such as language and alphabetical order, and placing them into
                    semantically significant categories such as topic or genre. Medieval European
                    libraries were tightly focused on Christian theology, but as secular books and
                    readers proliferated thanks to new technologies and increased literacy,
                    bibliographic classifications grew broader and more complex to accommodate them.
                    Modern classification systems are highly nuanced systems designed to encompass
                    all knowledge; however, they retain some of the same features and biases of
                    their forebears.</phrase></phrase><footnote xml:id="endnote-409" label="488"

                    </info>One of the earliest known libraries—at Nippur in Mesopotamia—was small
                    enough that its catalog needed no particular organization: the list of titles in
                    the collection fit onto two easily scanned clay tablets. As collections grew,
                    scribes made it easier to browse the contents of a collection by adding
                        <quote>colophons,</quote> brief descriptions containing a document’s title,
                    author, and place in a sequence of tablets <citation
                        xml:id="cite_Casson2002-7.3" linkend="Casson2002">(Casson 2002)</citation>.
                    A further step was the sorting of works into categories. A temple in the ancient
                    Egyptian city of Edfu placed books into different trunks based on their topics,
                    including royal duties, temple management, and timekeeping, as well as two
                    trunks each for astronomy and protection from crocodiles. The fabled library of
                    Alexandria in ancient Greece used categories based on Aristotle’s three modes of
                    thought: theoretical (e.g. mathematics, physics, metaphysics), practical
                    (ethics, politics, economics), and poetic (poetry, music, and art), plus a
                    fourth <quote>meta-category,</quote> logic, that applied to all of them.
                            <personname><surname>Callimachus</surname></personname>, one of the
                    library’s directors, created the Pinakes, a library catalog whose top-level
                    distinction was between poetry and prose (followed by genre, author, and work).
                    A few centuries later, librarians in the Chinese Wei and Jin dynasties
                    (third-fifth centuries CE) settled on four major categories—classics,
                    philosophy, history, and literature—that lasted well into the twentieth century.
                        <citation xml:id="cite_Shamurin1955" linkend="Shamurin1955">(Shamurin
                        1955)</citation> Unlike the Greek system, which classified authors, the
                    Chinese system classified individual works; some authors have suggested that
                    this reflects Western cultures’ greater emphasis on the individual. Medieval
                    libraries adapted ancient practices for their own needs: monastery libraries had
                    separate cabinets for topics such as Bibles, Church history, and Christian
                    poets, and divided their collections into Christian and secular literature
                    (meanwhile, scholars in the intellectually flourishing Muslim world classified
                    knowledge into Muslim and non-Muslim sciences) <citation

                    Today’s classification systems reflect both their debt to earlier systems and
                    the biases of their own cultures: the first category of the Universal Decimal
                    Classification, just like Aristotle’s <quote>logic</quote> category, is a
                    meta-category covering organization, documentation, and information science,
                    while the first top-level category of the Chinese Classification System is
                        <quote>Marxism, Leninism, Maoism, and Deng Xiaoping theory.</quote>

                        those for physical stores, but they are highly idiosyncratic and
                        non-standard. In contrast, scores of university libraries have five million
                        or more distinct items in their collections, and they almost all use the
                        same standard bibliographic classification system that has about 300,000
                        distinct categories.<footnote xml:id="endnote-411" label="490"

                        the previous one that distinguishes bibliographic classification systems is
                        that they have long been shaped and continue to be shaped by the legacy of
                        physical arrangement, user access to the storage locations, and re-shelving
                        that they support. These requirements constrain the evolution and
                        extensibility of bibliographic classifications, making them less able to
                        keep pace with changing concepts and new bodies of knowledge. Amazon
                        classifies the products it sells in huge warehouses, but its customers do
                        not have to pick out their purchases there, and most goods never return to
                        the warehouse. <orgname>Amazon</orgname> can add new product categories and
                        manage the resources in warehouses far more easily than libraries

                        are substantially eliminated, because the storage location is hidden from

                        However, when users can search the entire content of the library, as they
                        have learned to expect from the web, they are less likely to use the
                        bibliographic classification systems that have painstakingly been applied to
                        the library’s resources.</para>

                        reflects its unique characteristics. Wars (in the English language) are
                        generally named for the location of the fighting or the enemy being fought
                        (the Mexican-American War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War),
                        or for a particular ideal or ambition (the Revolutionary War, the Civil
                        War). The War of <date>1812</date> does not satisfy any of these naming
                        conventions; the war was fought across a huge range of geography from
                        eastern Canada to Louisiana, between a diverse range of groups from
                        Canadians and Native American tribes, with national armies getting involved
                        very late in the war. While nominally fought over freedom the seas, the war
                        quickly morphed into one about territorial ambition in North America. Of
                        course, if the world were a place where people could agree on naming
                        standards for wars, it is likely we would no longer have wars. See <link

                    <abbrev>PMEST</abbrev>) because the notation used for resource identifiers uses
                a colon to separate the values on each facet. These values come from tables of
                categories and subcategories, making the call number very compact. Colon
                classification is most commonly used in libraries in India.<footnote

                different facets, but both hoped that their five top-level facets would be

                used in narrow domains, each with its own specific facets. This makes intuitive
                sense because even if resources can be distinguished with a general classification,
                doing so requires lengthy notations, and it is much harder to add to a general
                classification than to a classification created specifically for a single subject
                area. We could probably describe shirts using the <abbrev>PMEST</abbrev> facets, but
                style, color, and size seem more natural.</para>

                    For example, a student writing a term paper or doing a course project checks out
                    books from the library’s taxonomic classification system (or prints them out
                    from the web) and then organizes them in piles on a desk or on the floor
                    according to the plan for the paper or project. Some of the original
                    classification might persist, but the emphasis clearly shifts toward getting
                    work done. When the task is completed the books go back to the library and are

            and ease of processing by computers, it should not be surprising that a great many
            computational classification problems involve text. Some of these problems are
            relatively simple, like identifying the language in which a text is written, which is
            solved by comparing the probability of one, two, and three character-long contiguous
            strings in the text against their probabilities in different languages. For example, in
            English the most likely strings are <quote>the</quote>, <quote>and</quote>,
                <quote>to</quote>, <quote>of</quote>, <quote>a</quote>, <quote>in</quote>, and so
            on. But if the most likely strings are <quote>der</quote>, <quote>die</quote>,
                <quote>und</quote>, and <quote>den</quote> the text is German and if they are
                <quote>de</quote>, <quote>la</quote>, <quote>que</quote>, <quote>el</quote>, and
                <quote>en</quote> the text is Spanish.</para>

            problems arise when more features are required to describe each instance being
            classified and where the features are less predictable. The unknown author of a document
            can sometimes be identified by analyzing other documents known to be written by him to
            identify a set of features like word frequency, phrase structure, and sentence length
            that create a <quote>writeprint</quote> analogous to a fingerprint that uniquely

            problem is sentiment analysis, determining whether a text has a positive or negative
            opinion about some topic. Much academic and commercial research has been conducted to
            understand the sentiment of Twitter tweets, Facebook posts, email sent to customer
            support applications, and other similar contexts. Sentiment analysis is hard because
            messages are often short so there is not much to analyze, and because and because
            sarcasm, slang, clichés, and cultural norms obscure the content needed to make the
            classification.</para>
        <para revision="3.0" revisionflag="added">A crucial consideration whenever supervised
            learning is used to train a classifier is ensuring that the training set is appropriate.
            If we were training a classifier to detect spam messages using email from the year 2000,
            the topics of the emails, the words they contain, and perhaps even the language they are
            written in would be substantially different than messages from this year. Up to date
            training data is especially important for the classification algorithms used by
                <orgname>Twitter</orgname>, <orgname>Facebook</orgname>, <orgname>YouTube</orgname>,
            and similar social sites that classify and recommend content based on popularity trends. </para>
        <para audience="Computing DS" revision="3.0" revisionflag="added">When the relevant training
            data is constantly changing and there is a great deal of it, there is a risk that by the
            time a model can learn to classify correctly it is already out of date. This challenge
            has led to the development of streaming algorithms that operate on data as it comes in,
            using it as a live data source rather than as a static training set. Streaming
            algorithms are essential for tackling datasets that are too large to store or for models
            that must operate under intense time pressure. Streaming approaches complement rather
            than replace those that work with historical datasets because they make different
            tradeoffs between accuracy and speed. The streaming system might provide real-time
            alerting and recommendations, while historical analyses are made on the batch-oriented
            system that works with the entire data collection.<footnote audience="Computing"

                or service review that is unambiguously positive, negative, or neutral? How would

                familiar type of supervised machine learning to classify resources is email spam
                filtering. Messages are classified as SPAM or HAM (i.e., non-SPAM); the former are
                sent to a SPAM folder, while the latter head to your inbox. We can describe this
