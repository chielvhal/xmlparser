            Homer and a woman named Marge, the married parents of three sibling children, a boy
            named Bart and two girls, Lisa and Maggie. This magical family speaks many languages,
            but most often uses the language of the local television station. In the
            English-speaking Simpson family, the boy describes his parents as his father and mother
            and his two siblings as his sisters. In the Spanish speaking Simpson family he refers to
            his parents as <foreignphrase xml:lang="es">su padre y su madre</foreignphrase> and his
            sisters are <foreignphrase xml:lang="es">las hermanas</foreignphrase>. In the Chinese

            to define resource types or classes, which more generally are called categories<phrase
                role="parenthetical"> (<xref linkend="chapter-7" xrefstyle="short"/>)</phrase>. We
            can then use resource types as one or both the components of a relationship when we want
            to further describe the resource type or to assert how two resource types go together to
            facilitate our interactions with them.</para>
        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-v5s_34r_lr">We begin with a more complete definition of
            relationship and introduce five perspectives for analyzing them: semantic, lexical,
            structural, architectural, and implementation. We then discuss each perspective,
            introducing the issues that each emphasizes, and the specialized vocabulary needed to
            describe and analyze relationships from that point of view. We apply these perspectives
            and vocabulary to analyze the most important types of relationships in organizing

        </info>We can express the relationship between Homer and Marge Simpson using a
                <emphasis>predicate(argument(s))</emphasis> syntax as follows: <informalexample
                xml:id="inf-ex-ch5-udg_phr_lr">
                <literallayout>
    <emphasis role="strong">is-married-to (Homer Simpson, Marge Simpson)</emphasis></literallayout>
            </informalexample> The sequence, type, and role of the arguments are an essential part
            of the relationship expression. 
             The sequence and role are explicitly distinguished when predicates that
            take two arguments are expressed using a <emphasis>subject-predicate-object</emphasis>
            syntax that is often called a <glossterm linkend="gloss_triple">triple</glossterm>
            because of its three parts: <informalexample xml:id="inf-ex-ch5-r1j_shr_lr">
                <literallayout>    <emphasis role="strong">Homer Simpson <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> is-married-to <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> Marge Simpson</emphasis></literallayout>
            </informalexample>
            However, we have not yet specified what the <quote>is-married-to</quote>
            relationship means. People can demonstrate their understanding of
                <quote>is-married-to</quote> by realizing that alternative and semantically
            equivalent expressions of the relationship between Homer and Marge might be:
                <informalexample xml:id="inf-ex-ch5-tdj_shr_lr">
                <literallayout>    <emphasis role="strong">Homer Simpson <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> is-married-to <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> Marge Simpson</emphasis>
    <emphasis role="strong">Homer Simpson <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> is-the-husband-of <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> Marge Simpson</emphasis>
    <emphasis role="strong">Marge Simpson <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> is-married-to <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> Homer Simpson</emphasis>
    <emphasis role="strong">Marge Simpson <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> is-the-wife-of <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> Homer Simpson</emphasis></literallayout>
            </informalexample> Going one step further, we could say that people understand the
            equivalence of these different expressions of the relationship because they have
            semantic and linguistic knowledge that relates some representation of
                <quote>married,</quote>
            <quote>husband,</quote>
            <quote>wife,</quote> and other words. None of that knowledge is visible in the
            expressions of the relationships so far, all of which specify concrete relationships
            about individuals and not abstract relationships between resource classes or concepts.
            We have simply pushed the problem of what it means to understand the expressions into
            the mind of the person doing the understanding.</para>
        <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-amv_34r_lr">We can be more rigorous and define the words
            used in these expressions so they are <quote>in the world</quote> rather than just

                    </info>Typically, when people use language they operate on the assumption that
                    everyone shares their model of the world, providing the common ground that
                    enables them to communicate. As we saw in <xref linkend="chapter-4"
                        xrefstyle="short"/> and <xref linkend="chapter-5" xrefstyle="short"/>,
                    (because of the <glossterm linkend="gloss_vocabulary_problem">vocabulary
                        problem</glossterm> and different purposes for using resources and language)
                    this assumption is often wrong, This paves the way for serious
                    misunderstandings, since what is assumed to be shared knowledge may not really
                    be shared or understood the same way.</para>
            </footnote> Furthermore, for a computer to understand the expressions, it needs a
            computer-processable representation of the relationships among words and meanings that
            makes every important semantic assumption and property precise and explicit. We will see
            what this takes starting in the next section.</para>

                    attributes are tightly coupled to a containing element, and their literal values
                    are limited to atomic items of information. In contrast, inclusion relationships
                    are expressed by literal containment of one <abbrev>XML</abbrev> element by
                    another.</para>

                described types and properties of semantic relationships in enough detail to return
                to the challenge we posed earlier: what information is required to fully understand
                relationships? This question has been asked and debated for decades and we will not
                pretend to answer it to any extent here. However, we can sketch out some of the
                basic parts of the solution.</para>

                captures a system of class inclusion relationships in some domain. But as we have
                seen, there are a great many kinds of relationships that are not about class
                inclusion. All of these other types of relationships represent knowledge about the
                domain that is potentially needed to understand statements about it and to make
                sense when more than one domain of resources or activities comes together.</para>

                    </info>Polysemy is represented in <application>WordNet</application> by
                    including a word in multiple synsets. This enables
                        <application>WordNet</application> to be an extremely useful resource for
                    sense disambiguation in natural language processing research and applications.
                    When a polysemous word is encountered, it and the words that are nearby in the
                    text are looked up in <application>WordNet</application>. By following the
                    lexical relationships in the synset hierarchy, a <quote>synset distance</quote>
                    can be calculated. The smallest semantic distance between the words, which
                    identifies their most semantically specific hypernym, can be used to identify
                    the correct sense. For example, in the sentence: <simplelist>
                        <member><emphasis role="bold">Put the money in the bank</emphasis></member>
                    </simplelist> Two of the three WordNet senses for <quote>money</quote> are: <simplelist>
                        <member>1) the most common medium of exchange</member>
                        <member>2) the official currency issued by a government or national
                            bank</member>
                    </simplelist> and the first two of the ten WordNet senses for
                        <quote>bank</quote> are: <simplelist>
                        <member>1) a financial institution that accepts deposits</member>
                        <member>2) sloping land, especially the slope beside a body of
                            water</member>
                    </simplelist> The synset hierarchies for the two senses of <quote>money</quote>
                    intersect after a very short path with the hierarchy for the first sense of
                        <quote>bank,</quote> but do not intersect with the second sense of
                        <quote>bank</quote> until they reach very abstract concepts.<footnote

                </info>We can return to our simple food taxonomy to illustrate how a thesaurus
                annotates vocabulary terms with lexical and semantic relationships. The class
                inclusion relationships of <glossterm linkend="gloss_hypernym">hypernomy</glossterm>
                and <glossterm linkend="gloss_hyponym">hyponymy</glossterm> are usually encoded
                using <literal>BT</literal> (<quote>broader term</quote>) and <literal>NT</literal>
                    (<quote>narrower term</quote>): <informalexample xml:id="inf-ex-ch5-ls3_z3r_lr">
                    <literallayout>        <emphasis role="strong">Food BT Meat
        Beef NT Meat</emphasis></literallayout>
                </informalexample> The BT and NT relationships in a thesaurus create a hierarchical
                system of words, but a thesaurus is more than a lexical taxonomy for some domain
                because it also encodes additional lexical relationships for the most important
                words. Many thesauri emphasize the cluster of relationships for these key words and
                de-emphasize the overall lexical hierarchy.</para>
            <para audience="LIS Linguistics" role="comparative" xml:id="para-atm_j4r_lr">Because the
                purpose of a thesaurus is to reduce synonymy, it distinguishes among synonyms or
                near-synonyms by indicating one of them as a preferred term using
                    <literal>UF</literal> (<quote>used for</quote>): <informalexample

                </informalexample>A thesaurus might employ <literal>USE</literal> as the inverse of
                the <literal>UF</literal> relationship to refer from a less preferred or variant
                term to a preferred one: <informalexample xml:id="inf-ex-ch5-fcw_y3r_lr">

                </informalexample>Thesauri also use <literal>RT</literal> (<quote>related
                    term</quote> or <quote>see also</quote>) to indicate terms that are not synonyms
                but which often occur in similar contexts: <informalexample

                prefixes and suffixes to leave the root form of words. Similarly, simple text
                processing applications like hyphenation and spelling correction solve word form
                problems using roots and rules because it is more scalable and robust than solving
                them using word lists. Many misspellings of common words (e.g., <quote>pain</quote>)
                are words of lower frequency (e.g., <quote>pane</quote>), so adding
                    <quote>pane</quote> to a list of misspelled words would occasionally identify it
                incorrectly. In addition, because natural languages are generative and create new
                words all the time, a word list can never be complete; for example, when
                    <quote>flickr</quote> occurs in text, is it a misspelling of

                            word? This question has long been debated in subject classification,
                            where it is framed as the contrast between

                    prefixes and suffixes, which usually create a word of a different part-of-speech

                actors are closer to the center of the movie universe than Bacon. Try some famous
                actors and see if their Bacon Numbers are greater or smaller than Bacon's. (Hint:

                found and selected using the XPath language, which defines the structures and
                patterns used by <abbrev>XML</abbrev> forms, queries, and transformations. The key
                idea used by XPath is that the structure of <abbrev>XML</abbrev> documents is a tree
                of information items called nodes, whose locations are described in terms of the
                relationships between nodes. The relationships built into XPath, which it calls
                axes, include self, child, parent, following, and preceding, making it very easy to
                specify a structure-based query like <quote>find all sections in Chapter 1 through

                    and prescriptions it offers. Institutional schemas tend to be more prescriptive
                    and restrictive, stressing professional orthodoxy and conformance to controlled
                    vocabularies. Schemas for the information content in social and informal
                    applications tend to be less prescriptive. Whether and how we use structural
                    metadata is a tradeoff. Structural metadata is essential to enable quality
                    control and maintenance in information collection and publishing processes, but
                    someone has to do the work to create it.</para>

                    structural hierarchy in a resource is often extracted and made into a separate

                In a printed media context, any given content resource is likely to only be
                presented once, and its page number is provided in the table of contents to allow
                the reader to locate the chapter, section or appendix in question. In a hypertext
                media context, a given resource may be a chapter in one book while being an appendix
                in another. Some tables of contents are created as a static structural description,
                but others are dynamically generated from the internal structures whenever the
                resource is accessed. In addition, other types of entry points can be generated from
                the names or descriptions of content components, like selectable lists of tables,

                    DocBook; it describes every XML element and attribute and prescribes their
                    grammatical forms. The schema lets us know that a formal paragraph must include
                    a title, and that a title may contain emphasis. A schema can also describe and
                    prescribe the lexical value space of a postal code, or require that every list
                    must have at least three items. The DocBook schema is well-documented and has
                    been production-tested in institutional publishing contexts for over twenty
                        years.<footnote xml:id="endnote-293" label="349" audience="Computing">

                for structure (e.g., every non-text component must have a title and caption) and
                presentation (e.g., <glossterm linkend="gloss_hypertext_link">hypertext

                                to distinguish hyperlinks (e.g., plain hyperlink, button, selectable

                    like this one makes it easy to see that some resources have more incoming or

                    analysis of link structures to computer programs, and there it is much better to
                    represent the link structures more abstractly in matrix form. In this matrix the
                    resource identifiers on the row and column heads represent the source and
                    destination of the link. This is a full matrix because not all of the links are
                    symmetric; a link from resource 1 to resource 2 does not imply one from 2 to

            amounts of new data are being created by increased tracking of online interactions and
            by all the active resources that are now part of the Internet of Things. Organizing

                entity types. An example that appears in numerous data modeling books is one like
                this: <informalexample xml:id="inf-ex-ch5-fxh_y3r_lr">
                    <literallayout xml:id="inf-ex-ch5-ucn_n3r_lr">    <emphasis role="strong">Supplier <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> provides <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> Part <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> assembled-in <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> Product</emphasis></literallayout>
                </informalexample> It is always possible to represent ternary relationships as a set
                of binary ones by creating a new entity type that relates to each of the others in
                turn. This new entity type is called a dummy in modeling practice. <informalexample
                    xml:id="inf-ex-ch5-q4f_n3r_lr">
                    <literallayout>    <emphasis role="strong">Supplier <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> provides <symbol>&#8594;</symbol> DUMMY</emphasis>

                </informalexample> This transformation from a sensible ternary relationship to three
                binary ones involving a DUMMY entity type undoubtedly seems strange, but it enables

                    requirement for implementation syntax is that it can represent all the
                    expressions that it needs to express.</phrase> For the examples in this chapter
                we have used an informal combination of English words and symbols (arrows and
                parentheses) that you could understand easily, but simple language is incapable of
                expressing most of what we readily say in English. But this benefit of natural
                language only accrues to people, and the more restrictive and formal syntax is
                easier to understand for computers.</para>

            <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-qqj_k4r_lr"><phrase role="statement">A second
                    consideration is that the implementation can be understood and used by its
                    intended users.</phrase> We can usually express a relationship in different
                languages while preserving its meaning, just as we can usually implement the same
                computing functionality in different programming languages. From a semantic
                perspective these three expressions are equivalent: <informalexample
                    xml:id="inf-ex-ch5-gzx_k3r_lr">
                    <literallayout>        <emphasis role="strong">My name is Homer Simpson</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="strong" xml:lang="fr">Mon nom est Homer Simpson</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="strong" xml:lang="de">Mein name ist Homer Simpson</emphasis></literallayout>
                </informalexample> However, whether these expressions are equivalent for someone
                reading them depends on which languages they understand.</para>
            <para audience="CORE" role="comparative" xml:id="para-ovj_k4r_lr">An analogous situation
                occurs with the implementation of web pages. <abbrev>HTML</abbrev> was invented as a
                language for encoding how web pages look in a browser, and most of the tags in
                    <abbrev>HTML</abbrev> represent the simple structure of an analogous print
                document. Representing paragraphs, list items and numbered headings with <tag

                information that can be analyzed and processed. This <quote>web for

                        implemented web documents using a presentation-oriented
                            <abbrev>HTML</abbrev> markup language. Designing <abbrev>HTML</abbrev>
                        to be conceptually simple and easy to implement led to its rapid adoption.
                            <abbrev>HTML</abbrev> documents can make assertions and describe
                        relationships using <tag class="attribute">REL</tag> and <tag
                            class="attribute">REV</tag> attributes, but browsers still do not
                        provide useful interactions for link relations.</para>
                </footnote> The essential technologies for making the web more semantic and
                relationships among web resources more explicit are applications of
