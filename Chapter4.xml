            artist, the medium, the year of its completion, and, of course, its title. Most of these
            map fairly obviously to the properties they describe; the title, owing to its prominence
            and expressive power, is often an exception.</para>

            the most important property of a painting was not the subject it depicted, but its
            purely aesthetic properties and their effect on the viewer. So Whistler named his
            paintings, which were mostly landscapes and portraits, in the manner of musical
            compositions: <citetitle>Nocturne in Black and Gold</citetitle>; <citetitle>Symphony in

            described it as a portrait of an elderly woman, this helps reinforce how wildly
            different names of the same resource can be. Resource descriptions and metadata provide
            meaning, but to whom? What is salient about a resource can depend on the context in
            which it is experienced, and thus may change over time. Descriptions that make sense to
            some people might not make sense to others. People searching on the <quote>wrong

            What information might be associated with these images? Modern cameras assign an
            identifier to the stored photograph and they also capture the technical description of
            the image’s production: the type of camera, lens, shutter speed, light sensitivity,
            aperture, and other settings.<footnote xml:id="endnote-190" label="228"

            >Consider a completely different context. Four 7-year old boys are selecting
                <hardware>Lego blocks</hardware> to complete their latest construction. The first
            boy is looking for <quote>cylinder one-ers,</quote> another for <quote>coke
                bottles,</quote> the third for <quote>golder wipers,</quote> and the final boy is
            looking for <quote>round one-bricks</quote>? It turns out, they are all the same thing;
            each boy has devised his own set of descriptive terms for the tiny building blocks. Some
            of their many descriptions are based on color alone (<quote>redder</quote>), some on
            color and shape (<quote>blue tunnel</quote>), some on role (<quote>connector</quote>),
            some on common cultural touchstones (<quote>light saber</quote>). Others, like

                    </info>The concept of metadata has been extended to include the tags, ratings,
                    bookmarks or other types of descriptions that individuals apply to individual
                    photos, blog or news items, or any other resource with a web presence. The
                    practice of <phrase remap="action">tagging</phrase> has emerged as a way to
                    apply labels to content in order to describe and identify it. Sets of tags are
                    useful in managing one’s collection of websites or digital media, in sharing
                    them with others, and enabling new types of interactions and services.<footnote

                            propose a conceptual model of tagging that includes (1) tags assigned to
                            a specific resource, (2) connections or links between resources, and (3)
                            connections or links between users and explain how any two of these can
                            be used to infer information about the other.</para>
                    </footnote> For example, users of <application>Last.fm</application> tag music
                    with labels that describe its nature, era, mood, or genre, and
                        <application>Last.fm</application> uses these tags to generate radio
                    stations that play music similar to that tag and related tags.</para>

                        <quote>burn</quote> and <quote>tree</quote> by another. This disparity in
                    the descriptors people use to categorize the same or similar resources can turn
                    systems that use tagging into a <quote>tag soup</quote> lacking in

                    </footnote> We have been using the word <quote>resource</quote> to refer to
                    anything that is being organized. In the context of <abbrev>RDF</abbrev> and the
                    web, however, <quote><glossterm linkend="gloss_resource"
                        >resource</glossterm></quote> means something more specific: a resource is
                    anything that has been given a <citerefentry><refentrytitle>Uniform Resource
                            Identifier</refentrytitle><manvolnum>URI</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
                        <abbrev>URI</abbrev>s can take various forms, but you are probably most
                    familiar with the <abbrev>URI</abbrev>s used to identify web pages, such as
                        <uri>http://springfield-elementary.edu/</uri>. (You are probably also used
                    to calling these <abbrev>URL</abbrev>s instead of <abbrev>URI</abbrev>s.) The
                    key idea behind <abbrev>RDF</abbrev> is that we can use <abbrev>URI</abbrev>s to
                    identify not only things <quote>on</quote> the web, like web pages, but also
                    things <quote>off</quote> the web like people or countries. For example, we
                    might use the <abbrev>URI</abbrev>
                    <uri>http://springfield-elementary.edu/</uri> to refer to <orgname>Springfield
                        Elementary</orgname> itself, and not just the school’s web page.</para>

                        Values can be resources too, but they do not have to be: when a property
                        takes simple values like numbers, dates, or text strings, these values do
                        not have URIs and so are not resources.</phrase></para>

                    resources); the HTML encoding the text, CSS that defines the formatting rules,
                    and the JPEG that encodes the image. All three have URLs and can independently
                    be retrieved and linked. The situation is even more ambiguous for the common
                    notion of a web site, the boundaries of which are not defined technically and
                    are cognitively difficult to express.</para>

                    for simplifying dissemination or organization, but they can also be
                    transformative; resources can derive nearly all their value from their inclusion
                    in an aggregation. On a web page, the CSS file is virtually useless on its own,
                    since its role is to style the HTML file. In <application>iTunes</application>,
                    the playback and organization functions are optimized for pop music, where
                    individual songs can usually stand on their own when separated from the rest of
                    an album. Classical music fans often struggle with this, because the individual
                        <quote>tracks</quote> of a recording, split up to reduce file size and
                    facilitate navigation through long works, are not separable; pieces are meant to
                    be listened to in their entirety, and it can be difficult to ensure that they
                    are aggregated together and have the proper metadata assigned to their
                    aggregations. In other words: you can't listen to symphonies on
                        shuffle.<footnote revision="3.0" revisionflag="added" audience="IA"

                <para revision="3.0" revisionflag="added">The problem here is how to architecturally
                    and technically express the notion of an aggregation, a set of information
                    objects that, when considered together, compose another named information
                    object. Aggregations are prevalent all over our digital information space: the
                    web page and site mentioned above; a scholarly publication consisting of text,
                    figures, and data; a dataset that is the composition of multiple data files.
                    Notably the notion is both recursive and non-exclusive. An object that is itself
                    an aggregation may be aggregated into another object. Information objects
                    included in one aggregation may also be included in other aggregations, allowing
                    reuse and re-factoring of existing information objects. A solution to this
                    problem is a critical aspect of organizing digital information because, without
                    well-defined boundaries we cannot deterministically identify, reference, or
                    describe information objects. </para>

                            components of digital library infrastructure; the content, naming
                            scheme, repository configuration, and access protocol. The digital
                            object they describe is a uniquely-identified container packaging
                            multiple data and metadata components. The model incorporates the
                            recursive notion of a container of containers. The Kahn/Wilensky
                            framework was the inspiration for the Fedora (Flexible Extensible

                            Metadata Initiative, the Warwick Framework was motivated by the desire
                            to associate multiple metadata packages with content (e.g., descriptive,
                            rights, administrative). It specifies a container architecture with
                            distinct metadata packages that could be included directly or
                            by-reference, allowing reuse of individual packages. The Warwick

                            specification was motivated by a desire for an aggregation architecture
                            fully congruent with web architecture principles, thus exposing
                            aggregations to standard web tools, e.g. browsers, crawlers, HTTP
                            servers. OAI-OARE introduces the notion of two types of URI-identified
                            web resources; a resource map and an aggregation. When de-referenced
                            through its respective URI, the former returns an REF/XML formatted
                            description that establishes the identity of the aggregation, the
                            resources that are included in the aggregation, and the semantics of the
                            relationships among them.<footnote label="248" revision="3.0"

                    other parts or resources. For example, we sometimes describe a football team as
                    a single resource and at other times we focus on each individual player.
                    However, after deciding on resource granularity, the question remains whether

                    not necessarily have its own bibliographic description. Similarly, business and

                            pairs. The database schema specifies the overall structure of the tables

                            that describe each resource. An employee table might have columns for

                    might want to buy domestic or locally-sourced goods out of economic patriotism
                    or to comply with procurement regulations. Not surprisingly, when consumers view
                    origin in a positive light, this information is conspicuous and easy to read. In
                    contrast, when consumers view origin less positively, perhaps as a warning of
                    low quality goods, the supplier is likely to make the origin information as
                    inconspicuous as legally possible, or might even misrepresent the goods as

                <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-s1j_b4r_lr">We have defined <glossterm
                        linkend="gloss_organizing">organizing</glossterm> as specifying the
                    principles for describing and arranging resources to create the capabilities
                    upon which interactions are based. This definition treats the creation of
                    resource descriptions and their use to organize resources for interactions as
                    separate and sequential activities. This is easiest to see when people  assign
                    keywords and classifications to documents, or when sensors produce data, and
                    these resource descriptions are later used to enable document retrieval or data
                    analysis. A department store clerk might sort dress shirts on a display table
                    using labels that describe their brands, sizes, and other properties. Rules
                    governing the collection, integration, and analysis of personal information are
                    also resource descriptions that influence the organization of information
                    resources.</para>
                
                
                
                
                <para audience="CORE" xml:id="para-kgj_b4r_lr">However, even if resource description
                    and resource organization are logically separable, at times they are
                    intertwined. When you arrange your own clothes, you don’t use explicit resource
                    descriptions and instead rely on implicit ones about easily perceived properties
                    like color, shape, and material of composition. When algorithms rather than
                    people analyze texts to identify descriptive features for applications like
                    information retrieval, spam classification, and sentiment analysis, resource
                    descriptions and resource organization co-evolve, often continuously as the
                    algorithm adapts and learns with each new resource it describes. This tight
                    connection between resource description and resource organization is also
                    exploited in organizing systems that use usage records from session logs,
                    browsing, or downloading activities as interaction resources, tying them to
                    payments for using the resources or analyzing them to influence the selection
                    and organizing of resources in future personalized interactions. <phrase

                    maintenance activities include version information and effectivity, or useful
                    life information. Equipment maintenance schedules are typically related to the
                    number of miles driven (indicated by a car’s odometer), number of hours operated
                    (stored by many engines), number of pages printed, or other easily recorded
                    information about resource use or interactions. With smart resources now capable
                    of capturing, analyzing, and communicating more data about real-time
                    performance, more sophisticated prediction and scheduling of maintenance work is
                    now possible. It is also easier to identify resources that are not being used as
                    much as expected, which might imply that they are no longer needed and can thus
                    be safely archived or discarded.</para>

                        insufficient on its own to yield a correct model is exemplified in the
                        interlocking efforts of <personname><firstname>Tycho</firstname>

                            <surname>Kepler</surname></personname>. Brahe was a 16th-century Danish
                        nobleman astronomer who spent decades collecting data about the positions of
                        hundreds of stars and the planets. However, because of prevailing religious
                        and scientific biases, Brahe accepted the incorrect assumptions that the sun
                        and planets revolved around the earth in circular orbits. After Brahe died
                        in 1601, Kepler spent a decade analyzing Brahe's data, and then rejected the
                        idea of earth-centric and circular planetary orbits in favor of elliptical
                        ones with the sun at one focus. These new organizing principles for Brahe’s
                        data made the model of the solar system vastly simpler, and Kepler was able
                        to discover laws of planetary motion that are part of the foundation of
                        modern astronomy and physics.<footnote audience="DS" revision="4.0"

                    from collections of samples, observations, or measurements. It is critical to

                    between the competing goals of understanding a particular collection or dataset
                    and being able to apply that understanding to new instances. Models can differ
                    in the number of resource descriptions they use as parameters, and it is easy
                    and tempting to overfit a model by using more parameters that capture random
                    variations in observations. Overfitting produces spurious accuracy in
                    reproducing the original observations, but it makes models less
                    generalizable.</para>

                    of sensemaking is the creation of scientific models or theories that propose
                    interpretable and causal mechanisms for the observations. And just as automatic
                    sensemaking creates simple explanations, scientists generally prefer simpler
                    theories, a heuristic known as Occam’s Razor, or the law of parsimony. Even
                    though complex theories can sometimes be more accurate, simpler theories produce
                    more testable predictions, making it easier to verify or refine the theory.
                    Occam’s famous principle, expressed eight centuries ago, is to prefer models
                    that make the fewest assumptions, often measured in terms of the number of
                    parameters or variables needed to make a prediction.<footnote

                discussed the problems of naming and proposed principles for good names, and since
                names are a very important resource description, much of what we said there applies
                generally to the design of the description vocabulary.</para>

                vocabulary as a whole is much more than just the resource name, we need to propose
                additional principles or guidelines for this step. In addition, some new design
                questions arise when we consider all the resource descriptions as a set whose
                separate descriptions are created by many people over some period of time.</para>

                    This is a core idea that we cannot overemphasize because it is implicit in every
                    step of the process of resource description. All of the design principles in the
                    previous section share the idea that the design of the description vocabulary
                    should focus on the user of the descriptions. <phrase role="interrogative">Are
                        the resources being organized personal ones, for personal and mostly private
                        purposes?</phrase> In that case, the description properties and terms can be
                    highly personal or idiosyncratic and still follow the design principles.</para>
                <para audience="CORE" role="comparative" xml:id="para-sjz_b4r_lr">Similarly, when
                    resource users share relevant knowledge, or are in a context where they can
                    communicate and negotiate, if necessary, to identify the resources, their
                    resource descriptions can afford to be less precise and rigorous than they might
                    otherwise need to be. This helps explain the curious descriptions in the
                        <hardware>Lego</hardware> story with which we began this chapter. The boys
                    playing with the blocks were talking to each other with the
                        <hardware>Legos</hardware> in front of them. If they had not been able to
                    see the blocks the others were talking about, or if they had to describe their
                    toys to someone who had never played with <hardware>Legos</hardware> before,
                    their descriptions would have been quite different.</para>
                <para audience="CORE" role="contrast" xml:id="para-ppz_b4r_lr">More often, however,
                    resource descriptions can not assume this degree of shared context and must be
                    designed for user categories rather than individual users: library users
                    searching for books, business employees or customers using part and product
                    catalogs, scientists analyzing the datasets from experiments or simulations. In
                    each of these situations resource descriptions will need to be understood by
                    people who did not create them, so the design of the description vocabulary
                    needs to be more deliberate and systematic to ensure that its terms are
                    unambiguous and sufficient to ensure reliable context-free interpretation.

                    Instead, many people working together typically develop the required description
                    vocabulary. We call the results institutional vocabularies, to contrast them

                    techniques might sound imposing and they are computationally complex, but they
                    all have the same simple concept at their core, that the features or properties
                    that describe some resource are often highly correlated. For example, a document
                    that contains the word <quote>car</quote> is more likely to contain the words
                        <quote>driver</quote> and <quote>traffic</quote> than a document that does
                    not. Similar correlations exist among the visual features used to describe
                    images and the acoustic features that describe music. Dimensionality reduction
                    techniques analyze the correlations between resource descriptions to transform a
                    large set of descriptions into a much smaller set of uncorrelated ones. In a way
                    this implements the principle of Sufficiency and Necessity we mentioned in <xref

                    properties that do not contribute much to distinguishing the resources.</para>

                    that illustrates the idea. Suppose we have a collection of resources, and every
                    resource described as <quote>big</quote> is also described as
                        <quote>red,</quote> and every <quote>small</quote> resource is also
                        <quote>green.</quote> This perfect correlation between color and size means
                    that either of these properties is sufficient to distinguish <quote>big

                    clever algorithms to figure that out. But if we have thousands of properties and
                    the correlations are only partial, we need the sophisticated statistical
                    approaches to choose the optimal set of description properties and terms, and in

                </info>Many different computational approaches have been used to describe or
                classify images. One approach uses the visual signature of an image extracted from
                low-level features like color, shape, texture, and luminosity, which are then used
                to distinguish significant regions and objects. Image similarity is computed to
                create categories of images that contain the same kinds of colors, objects, or
                settings, which makes it easy to find duplicate or modified images.<footnote

                specific objects or people in images, it is logically necessary to train them with
                images that are already identified. In 2005 <personname><firstname>Luis</firstname>
                    <surname>van Ahn</surname></personname> devised a clever way to collect large
                amounts of labeled images with a web-based game called ESP that randomly paired
                people to suggest labels or tags for an image. The obvious choices were removed from
                contention, so a photo of a bird against a blue sky might already strike
                    <quote>bird</quote> and <quote>sky</quote> from the set of acceptable words,
                leaving users to suggest words such as <quote>flying</quote> and
                    <quote>cloudless.</quote> Van Ahn also invented the reCAPTCHA technique that
                presents images of text from old books being digitized, which improves the accuracy
                of the digitization while verifying that the user of a web site is a person and not

                properties are the only features available to train an image, otherwise irrelevant
                variations in the position, orientation, or illumination of objects in images will
                make it very difficult to distinguish objects that look similar, like a white wolf
                and the wolf-like white dog called a Samoyed. This problem can be addressed by using
                deep neural networks, which exploit the idea that low-level image features can be
                combined into many layers of higher-level ones; edges combine to form motifs or
                patterns, patterns combine to form parts of familiar objects, and parts combine to
                form complete objects. This hierarchical composition enables the highest-level
                representations to become insensitive to the lower-level variations that plague the
                other approaches.</para>

                dataset of about a million images that contained a thousand different object
                categories, they reduced the error rate by half. This spectacular breakthrough, and
                the fact that the deep learning techniques that derive layers of features from the
                input data are completely general, rapidly caused deep learning to be applied to
                many other domains with high-dimensional data. <application>Facebook</application>

                </info>Describing music presents challenges quite different from those involved in
                describing texts or images. Poems and paintings are tangible things that we can look
                at and contemplate, while the aural nature of music means that it is a fleeting
                phenomenon that can only be experienced in the performative moment. Even musical
                scores and recordings, while as much tangible things as paintings and poems, are
                merely containers that hold the potential for musical experience and not the music
                itself. Most contemporary popular music is in the form of songs, in which texts are
                set to a melody and supported by instrumental harmonies. If we want to categorize or
                describe such music by its lyrical content, we can still rely on methods for
                describing texts. But if we want to describe the music itself, we need to take a
                somewhat different approach.</para>

                of music classification and description. Pandora, for example, employs trained
                musicologists to listen to the music and then categorize the genres and musical
                materials according to a highly controlled musical vocabulary. The resulting
                algorithm, the <quote>Music Genome,</quote> can essentially learn to define a
                listener’s musical tastes by means of this musical tagging, and can then use that
                information to suggest other music with similar characteristics.<footnote

                which it derives. Ethnomusicology (loosely defined as the study of global musical

                comprehensive descriptions of musical resources than any other field of
                musicological study. Since the late 19th century,
                    <jobtitle>ethnomusicologists</jobtitle> have created complex methods of notation

                endlessly innovative in finding ways to categorize, describe, and analyze not simply
                large-scale musical genres, but the notes themselves. In the accompanying photo
                showing the record collection of professional DJ <quote>Kid Kameleon,</quote> we see
                that the records are arranged not simply by genre, but also by beats-per-minute
                (BPM). For Kid Kameleon, these records represent the resources of his musical
                creative process, and arranging them by BPM allows him to pull exactly the correct
                musical material he needs to keep the music flowing during a performance. His
                classification system is therefore a taxonomy that moves from the broad strokes of
                genre down to the fine grains of specific arrangements of notes and rhythms. This
                photo is not simply a picture of a record collection: it is a visual representation
                of an artist’s creative process.<footnote revision="3.0" revisionflag="added"

                        making it possible to discover or create resource properties that are called
                            <quote>latent</quote> because they are inferred rather than
                        observed.</para>

                        instead of the vocabulary that people would otherwise use. A controlled
                        vocabulary reduces synonymy and homonymy.</para>
